My name is Alana, and I am currently the primary carer for my 64-year-old mother who lives with me in our rural community of Kangaroo Island, postcode 5225. As our population ages, the responsibility of caring falls heavily on family members like me, navigating the complexities of health and aged care systems without adequate support.

The isolation of our location exacerbates this challenge, making access to services not only scarce but often completely unattainable without significant travel and expense. Each week, I find myself overwhelmed by the logistics of managing my mother's care, from scheduling medical appointments to understanding the maze of available aged care and home care services.

Moreover, the emotional toll and the strain on my personal and professional life are profound. Constantly juggling these responsibilities with no end in sight has left me both physically exhausted and mentally strained. 

It is for this reason that I am reaching out to urge your support for a national program like Violet’s, which aims to provide families like mine with vital guidance and support. Such a program would offer a lifeline, helping us to navigate the health and aged care systems more effectively, reducing the emotional burden, and allowing us to maintain our livelihoods while caring for our loved ones.

Please advocate for better caregiver support on a national level, ensuring that all Australians, regardless of where they live, have access to the resources they need during these challenging times.

Yours sincerely,

My name is Gill Jewell, and I am currently navigating the profoundly challenging journey of preparing for the end-of-life care of my father. This period has spotlighted an array of difficulties, most notably the struggle to bring my family out of denial regarding the inevitability and the necessity of such planning.

Living in a rural suburb, the lack of accessible resources and services for elderly care compounds these challenges. The emotional toll and time required to manage these responsibilities alongside personal commitments are overwhelming. The journey is isolating, and the fear and uncertainty of not knowing if I am making the right decisions weigh heavily on me.

The support that would immensely change our lives includes guidance and assistance with end-of-life planning that respects the dignity of my father’s final years. This support would not only help us but also lighten the similar burdens on countless other Australian families facing these inevitable challenges.

I urge you to advocate for and support the implementation of Violet's national program. This initiative promises to provide essential support through practical guidance and emotional support that is crucial for caregivers nationwide, especially in rural and regional areas like ours.

By backing this program, you can help ensure that families can approach this sensitive phase with the respect and dignity it deserves. Your support could make a significant difference in the lives of countless Australians grappling with the complexities of aged care.

I write to you deeply concerned, both as a daughter and a member of the growing ‘Sandwich Generation’, managing the demanding role of caring for my 83-year-old father, Friedrich, from a distance. Despite him having a home care package, it falls short due to staffing shortages in our rural area of Berri, SA.

Each week, I dedicate numerous hours coordinating his care, which includes making phone calls to My Aged Care and his care coordinator, organising medical appointments, managing his finances, and ensuring he adheres to his medication. This commitment strains not only my professional life but also impacts my personal well-being, especially as I am anticipating the arrival of a grandchild.

The intermittent nature of the care available has left both my father and me in constant stress. This phase in our lives, which should be less worrisome and more fulfilling, is marred by uncertainty and exhaustion. The current system makes it challenging to access continuous and reliable support, a plight faced by many caregivers across the nation, particularly in rural and regional areas.

I urge for your active support in advocating for more comprehensive and effective national support frameworks. Improved navigation through health and aged care services, and a move towards consistent and adequate care provisions, would significantly alleviate the burdens faced by family caregivers.

Please consider bolstering support for caregivers by backing initiatives like Violet’s national program, addressing the unique challenges inherent in remote caregiving and ensuring our elderly can live with the dignity they deserve.

My name is Desi Komakis from the suburb of Allenby Gardens, and I am navigating the all-too-common challenge of preparing to care for my elderly parents. Like many Australians, I face the daunting task of providing for their upcoming needs without a clear understanding of where to begin or what resources are available.

The prospect of balancing their care with my existing responsibilities frightens me, threading worry into my daily life. The hardest part has been the overwhelming feeling of not knowing where to start. How do I secure reliable health services, aged care and home care without exhaustive and draining trials?

This looming responsibility for my parents' wellbeing heralds a significant shift in my life and underscores a broader national issue — the urgent need for comprehensive support and guidance for caregivers. Navigating health and aged care systems, especially without prior experience or knowledge, is a common challenge many Australians will face as the population ages.

To this end, I appeal to you to support the implementation of Violet's national program. This initiative is vital as it promises to offer vital navigation assistance through health, aged care, and home care services, helping caregivers like me prepare better for this critical role.

Such support would not only transform my ability to manage the care of my parents effectively, but it would also provide similar relief for countless Australians faced with these daunting caregiving responsibilities.

I trust that you will consider advocating for this essential support to ensure all caregivers have the resources they need for this significant life transition.

My name is Lea-An, I’m writing not only on behalf of myself, but for countless Australians caught in the growing ‘Sandwich Generation’—those of us caring for ageing parents while trying to manage our own lives and responsibilities.

In the past 12 months, my life has been turned upside down. After my mother’s passing in September 2024, my 78-year-old father, Tom—who has dementia and diabetes—came to live with my partner and me in February 2024. 
Caring for him involves managing his meals, medication, daily routines, and ensuring he stays active. I’ve also returned to full-time work after receiving some support through his My Aged Care package (level 4), but the emotional and physical toll has been a lot.

My mum’s decline began after a fall in January 2024 while under my brother’s care. She was hospitalised and sadly could not return home due to the toxic and unsafe environment there. She entered a nursing home and passed away later that year from dementia and other health issues. Dad and I visited her as often as we could—despite living 50 minutes from the hospital and 40 minutes from the nursing home.

The situation at my parents’ home remains distressing. One of my brothers, who struggles with mental health issues linked to drug use, continues to live there despite being asked to leave multiple times. He contributes nothing financially and has remained in the home even after Dad moved out. I changed the locks, but he found a way back in. Police have been called numerous times due to his behaviour, and I’ve received very little support in trying to legally remove him. Thankfully, a social worker from the GEM team is now assisting us, which has been a blessing. They connected us with a community lawyer and supporting us through the SACAT process.

Emotionally, I’ve been running on empty. The hardest part of all this has been watching my dad slowly decline while feeling completely unprepared to manage the stages of dementia. I often don’t know if I'm  handling daily conversations correctly or how best to support him, and I live in constant fear that he’ll end up in a nursing home—just like my mum did—something I’m desperate to avoid. 

I want him to live his remaining years in a place where he feels safe, respected, and surrounded by love with family & his dog.
One of the most positive and uplifting supports in our lives right now is the ECH Wellness site, which we affectionately call his “daycare.” Currently, he only attends once a week (Due to the cost $200 a day this isn't including the cost of a carer picking him up/ dropping him off and their time - this comes out of his level 4 package), 

It would make such a difference to his wellbeing if he could attend more often—ideally weekdays. At ECH, he’s mentally and physically engaged through music, exercise, and woodwork. It’s a space where he connects socially, which is so important for those living with dementia.
This kind of arrangement—living at home with family while attending the Wellness site for daily enrichment—would allow Dad to live a longer, happier, and more fulfilled life. It would also provide my partner and me with crucial respite and peace of mind, knowing he’s supported both emotionally and socially.

That’s why I’m urging you to advocate for and support funding for Violet’s national program. It would provide compassionate, practical guidance to carers like myself who are struggling to understand dementia, make informed care decisions, and maintain our own emotional wellbeing. As our population ages, programs like Violet and increased access to community-based day care options are vital—not only for the elderly but also for the family members who are their lifelines.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my story and the pressing need for stronger, more accessible aged care support.
Kind regards,

My name is Yvonne Faure, and I live in the suburb of Walkerville. I write to you both as a concerned citizen and a daughter who is caring for her elderly mother, Ann. Over the past few years, my caregiving responsibilities have increased significantly, impacting my time and emotional well-being. The essence of our struggle lies in managing the complexities of elderly care while maintaining a balanced personal and professional life.

Caring for Ann has highlighted the intensive demands placed upon individuals like myself, who find themselves part of the 'Sandwich Generation'—juggling the needs of aging parents while supporting our own families. The hardest part of this journey has been not just the day-to-day physical care but also facilitating crucial conversations about her future care and needs.

In regions like ours, where services can be less accessible, the challenge intensifies. The emotional toll and time consumed in ensuring adequate care are substantial and often go unnoticed in broader policy discussions.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support the implementation of Violet's national program. This initiative is critical as it promises to provide vital resources, emotional support, and guidance on navigating aged care services effectively. Such support would not only benefit caregivers and their families but is essential as Australia's population continues to age.

By supporting this program, we can ensure that Australians like myself have the resources needed to care for our loved ones without compromising our health, careers, and familial relationships.

My name is Andi Crossan from The Basin, VIC 3154, and I am reaching out to highlight the plight of individuals like myself who are part of the Sandwich Generation, caring for elderly parents while managing other personal responsibilities. I currently support my parents aged 86 and 81, a role that has evolved significantly requiring more intense involvement like organising meals, managing appointments, and overseeing care plans. This transition from daughter to carer has profoundly altered our relationship and dynamics.

The emotional and logistical toll of these duties is considerable. Managing the family dynamics, particularly under stress, becomes a challenge, about which my family and I feel unprepared. Support systems that facilitate discussion and resolutions within families would be invaluable to me.

Rural settings exacerbate these difficulties, where services can be sparse and the sense of isolation overwhelming. Caregivers in these locations face unique hurdles that need addressing through comprehensive national strategies.

I urge you to support the implementation of Violet's national program, designed to alleviate these pressures by offering effective guidance, emotional support, and tailored services to family caregivers. Enhanced caregiver support is essential as Australia’s aging population grows, ensuring caregivers are equipped, supported, and valued for the critical role they play in our society.

Thank you for considering this vital cause, which impacts millions across our nation, ensuring our elderly can live their later years with dignity and support.

My name is Simone Webb, and I'm currently faced with the daunting task of caring for my elderly parents who live overseas. As they age, their desire to remain independent in their home grows, yet so does the challenge to support them from afar. They frequently require help with daily tasks such as gardening, grocery shopping, and maintaining their household, which leaves me in constant worry and necessitates frequent travel to ensure their well-being.

One of the hardest aspects of this caregiving role is securing appropriate help to keep them safely in their home, respecting their independence while ensuring their safety and health. The emotional toll of managing this, coupled with my everyday responsibilities here in Australia, is significant. The strain is not just emotional but logistical, impacting my ability to balance this care with my other obligations.

Navigating the maze of health, aged care, and home care services from a distance complicates these responsibilities further. Therefore, I strongly urge you to support initiatives like Violet’s national program, which aims to provide essential guidance and support to caregivers like myself. This program would be instrumental in offering practical advice and emotional support, helping us to manage better the complex needs of our aging loved ones.

I hope you will advocate for policies and programs that enhance support for overseas caregivers and improve aged care services globally to ensure the dignity and safety of our elders. Your support can significantly relieve the burden on families like mine, creating a more compassionate and effective care system.

My name is Natasha Suzanne Dane, and I currently reside in postcode 3178, where I have taken on the full-time role of caring for my 84-year-old mother, Anna. In the past few years, my life has dramatically transformed as I have assumed total responsibility for her care, encompassing not only her health and daily needs but also challenging financial decisions and living arrangements.

My mother lives with me full-time, placing me squarely in the 'Sandwich Generation,' as I juggle her care with other familial and work commitments. The hardest part of this experience has been the evident loss of my independence and previous lifestyle, leading to feelings of isolation and increased mental load. It's a constant struggle managing the dynamics within my family, particularly during times of stress or disagreement on care decisions.

The weight of these responsibilities is a common story across Australia, especially among caregivers in similar situations, and underscores the pressing need for structured support systems. Access to services like Violet’s national program could greatly alleviate the mental and emotional burdens by aiding in navigation of aged care services, proving counselling, and offering practical assistance.

I kindly urge you to advocate for and support funding for initiatives like Violet’s national program designed to help caregivers like myself manage these overwhelming duties more effectively. A national focus on supporting the aging population and their caregivers is crucial as Australia's demographic continues to evolve.

My name is Sara Maskall, and I am writing to you today not just as a voter in the 3178 postcode, but as a daughter, mother, and carer deeply entrenched in the challenges posed by the responsibility of caring for ageing parents in rural Rowville. My father, aged 78 with dementia, and my mother, aged 75 with severe low vision, require my constant support and attention. Each day, we navigate their complex health needs alongside my demanding career in early childhood education and the needs of my two adult children, one of whom has not yet found stable employment.

The struggle of watching my father's deteriorating condition and not having sufficient resources or time to provide the care he deserves is heart-wrenching. The emotional toll and the impact on my work and family life are significant. The challenge further amplifies given our location which limits access to specialised health and aged care services that could ease our burden.

The support that would transform our lives includes more accessible healthcare services in remote areas like ours, and better guidance in navigating the maze of aged and home care services. Families, especially in the 'Sandwich Generation' who care for both children and elderly parents, desperately need systemic backing to manage these complex roles.

I urge you to advocate for broader support and funding for programs like Violet’s national initiative, which would provide essential guidance, emotional support, and help navigating aged care for families like mine. Such support not only aids individual families but strengthens our community’s capacity to care for its ageing population.

My name is Mandy Sawatzki from the suburb of Ringwood, postcode 3134. I am currently the primary caregiver for my elderly parents, aged 80 and 85. My caregiving responsibilities have intensified due to their progressive mobility and cognitive decline from motor neurone disease.

My daily responsibilities include managing their medical needs, ensuring their safety at home, and trying to maintain the quality of their life through regular outings which are becoming increasingly difficult. Watching them lose their independence and seeing the vibrant individuals they once were fade away is heart-wrenchingly painful.

The emotional and physical toll of caregiving, coupled with the challenges of accessing specialised support in our area, is overwhelming.

This program would significantly benefit from government backing to provide essential services and support for caregivers nationwide, particularly those dealing with complex diseases like motor neurone disease in less urban areas.

My name is Noelene Patterson-Dodge from Ringwood, postcode 3134. I write to you not only on behalf of my mum, Kathleen Patterson, aged 84, but also as a representative of countless Australians caught in the responsibilities of the 'Sandwich Generation.' Balancing a full-time job and family, while ensuring Mum, who staunchly wishes to remain out of aged care, gets the daily attention she needs, stretches my capacities daily.

Navigating mum's appointments, managing her finances, and coordinating with various health service providers from cleaners to exercise physiologists are among my day-to-day duties.

I am writing to you as a 44-year-old dealing with significant personal health challenges while living alone in the suburbs of Melbourne. In recent years, especially during lockdown, my medical issues have intensified, demonstrating that healthcare needs can escalate significantly, even before reaching old age.

The daunting task of managing my health care without immediate family support has led me on a relentless pursuit for assistance, which often appears fragmented and inaccessible. The constant pushing from pillar to post in attempts to access necessary services is not just exhausting but deeply troubling.

As Australians, we face a dual challenge: an ageing population requiring increased medical and aged care, paired with growing numbers of younger individuals with significant health needs struggling in the interim. The emotional, financial, and physical burdens I endure daily highlight a critical gap in our care systems.

For those like myself, and the future older population, streamlined access to comprehensive health, aged care, and home care services is crucial. It could considerably ease the journey and improve the quality of life for many.

I urge you, alongside your colleagues, to advocate for the establishment and support of integrated service models that address the complexities and intersections of health and aged care. We need a system that recognises and adequately supports all stages of health, from preventive strategies to end-of-life care, across all ages.

My name is Selina Stewart, living in the 3351 area, and I am reaching out amidst the daily challenges I face as a full-time worker and the sole carer for my 87-year-old mother, Helen. As an only child, the weight of her increasing needs rests solely on my shoulders. Despite my desire to provide more for her, the constraints of full-time employment and my other responsibilities prevent me from giving the care she undoubtedly needs.

My mother lives independently, and to ensure she remains part of our family life and does not succumb to loneliness, I invite her to our home for meals and movies. These moments, although heartwarming, are also my way of subtly assessing her wellbeing. Unfortunately, juggling these responsibilities is taking its toll, leaving me feeling perpetually guilty for not doing enough and anxious about her future care.

What compounds these challenges is my location in a somewhat remote area where access to specialised aged care services and guidance on navigating them are significantly lacking. I often feel overwhelmed, not just by the time commitment but also by my lack of knowledge about the available support and how best to utilise it for my mother's needs.

Thus, I urge your support in advocating for enhancements to caregiver support systems, especially for those of us in rural areas. Programs like Violet’s national program are vital, providing caregivers with essential information, resources, and emotional backing we desperately need.

Caring for an elderly parent in a rural area presents unique challenges. Access to services is limited, and the distance to adequate healthcare facilities is significant.

Additionally, I am raising my niece alongside my own teenagers, creating a complex family dynamic exacerbated by caregiving demands and financial constraints.

Providing approximately 30 hours a week in care for my mother involves managing her medical needs and daily living activities, all while navigating the challenging behaviour stemming from her memory issues.

I am writing to you as a resident of postcode 5372, who is deeply entrenched in the day-to-day care of my 87-year-old mother-in-law. Having her move into our home permanently has profoundly altered my life and highlighted the significant challenges faced by family caregivers like myself, particularly as I manage this responsibility alongside my own disability.

Caring for her is a continuous cycle of managing age-related medical issues, which leaves little room for my own health needs, including the essential but unaffordable expenses such as a wheelchair. The assumption that her care is solely my responsibility because she lives with us has placed us under immense emotional and physical strain. The expectation that my husband and I forfeit our respite is also an unwarranted pressure, especially without sufficient external support.

The hardest part of this caregiving journey is the overwhelming responsibility with minimal support. For us, navigating family dynamics and arranging stress-free downtime would make a substantial difference. Ensuring adequate wellbeing for caregivers, who are relentlessly juggling their health and immense caregiving duties, should be an intrinsic part of our healthcare policy.

I urge you to advocate for the support of Violet's national program, which promises to significantly ameliorate the burden on caregivers by providing necessary guidance, emotional support, and assistance in managing aged care. Such initiatives are essential as our population ages, ensuring those like myself are supported to care for our loved ones without sacrificing our health and welfare.

Thank you for considering this vital cause.

I am Annette Chapman from Mannum, a registered nurse and a daughter currently navigating the delicate balance of caregiving and professional life. I write to you not only for myself but on behalf of countless Australians in similar situations who yearn for a more supportive framework for caregivers.

Recently, I've transitioned from caring for my father during his palliative stages to ensuring my 77-year-old mother, Brigitta, can remain at home as she ages. This involves daily phone check-ins and frequent trips to see her, as she lives over an hour away. This commitment is straining both my emotional well-being and my professional obligations as a nurse.

The logistical and emotional challenges of caregiving are accentuated as I face the heart-wrenching reality of potentially leaving my career to ensure adequate care for my mother. Moreover, residing and caring for someone in a rural area compounds these challenges, with fewer resources and support systems readily available.

Supportive measures for caregivers, especially in rural regions like ours, would significantly impact our ability to maintain our own livelihoods while giving the best care to our loved ones. I urge you to advocate for the expansion of initiatives such as Violet’s national program, which promises to offer vital support through guidance, emotional support, and navigational help with aged care services.

An investment in caregiver support is imperative as Australia’s population ages. It’s not only a societal benefit but a necessity that will shape the fabric of our communities moving forward.

Yours sincerely,

My name is Catherine Lawless, and I am writing to you from Murray Bridge, where I am currently the primary caregiver for my elderly parents, ages 87 and 92. My role as their carer has dramatically increased over recent years, transforming into a commitment akin to a full-time job. I travel regularly from my regional town to ensure they receive the care they need, from managing their medical appointments to handling their daily needs.

The task of securing appropriate services is daunting, particularly with the current scarcity of providers who have the capacity to help. Navigating systems like MyAged Care has also been incredibly challenging, compounded by the delay in getting funding once my parents were finally approved, which took anywhere from 12 to 18 months. This bureaucratic maze, coupled with the urgent need for care due to my parents' advanced ages, weighs heavily on me.

Support that would assist in managing and simplifying health, aged care and home care services would be invaluable. The ability to have important conversations and efficiently handle family dynamics under stress would markedly ease the hardships we face.

I urge you to recognise the unique challenges faced by those of us in rural and regional areas, where resources are often limited or stretched thin. Support for Violet's national program would be a significant step forward, providing much-needed guidance and assistance to families like mine. Please consider advocating for better caregiver support nationally, helping us navigate and manage the responsibilities of caring for aging loved ones in our community.

My name is Michelle Daw, and I am reaching out to share my personal journey as a caregiver to both my ageing parents who are 91 and 87 years old. My mother, now residing in aged care due to mobility issues, and my father, who lives with ongoing health complications, depend largely on my support. Balancing their needs alongside my own family’s, including missing my son's football games due to caregiving responsibilities, has become a substantial emotional strain for me.

Recently, I was forced to reduce my employment to just one day a week to devote more time to my parents. The financial repercussions led us to refinance our home to support both my immediate family and my caregiving responsibilities. The emotional toll is considerable, with guilt pulling me between my parents and my son’s important activities.

Navigating these challenges from my location in 5253, where resources are not as readily accessible as in urban centres, compounds these struggles. Those of us in rural areas face even graver difficulties due to the lack of nearby specialised services and facilities.

I urge you to consider advocating for expanded support systems like those proposed by Violet’s national program which would greatly assist caregivers like myself, not only emotionally but also in managing the intricacies of aged care. A more robust national support system would also ensure that Australians who aren’t as fortunate to have family advocates are not left to manage alone.

This support would not only change my life but would assure better care for our elderly population and relief for their families. Please help us navigate this incredibly tough journey with dignity and support.

My name is Leonie G Feutrill, and I live in Mt Torrens, a rural area where resources are thinly spread. Currently, I am the primary carer for my elderly mother, Gaynor, who has escalating health needs and requires constant support. Up until recently, I've also been juggling the stress of placing my father into residential care while managing my mother's comprehensive needs, which include everything from daily health management to financial affairs and household maintenance.

Each day brings its own set of challenges. From ensuring my mother's health appointments are kept to handling her anxiety and maintaining her home, the responsibilities are endless. Additionally, being in a rural location compounds these challenges due to limited local services and professionals. The constant phone calls, transporting to different appointments, and managing home care packages are a significant strain on both my time and emotional health.

What would substantially aid my situation, and countless others in similar ones, is more structured support in navigating health, aged care, and home care services effectively. Assistance in having essential conversations and planning for the end stages of life would not only alleviate some of our burdens but also enhance the quality of care we can provide to our loved ones.

Thus, I am reaching out to you to advocate for increased backing for Violet’s national program. This initiative promises practical help and emotional support, which is crucial for caregivers like me, especially in remote areas. Your support could make a profound difference to our lives and the lives of those we care for.

My name is Sascha Costigan from Arncliffe. I am reaching out to illustrate the profound need for enhanced support for caregivers in our community. I have been the primary carer for my elderly parents – Mum, 89 with Alzheimer's, and Dad, 94 with reduced mobility. Their care demands escalated suddenly after both required immediate placement in full-time care following hospital emergencies. Until this shift, I balanced daily care, professional responsibilities in home-based aged care, and raising young children.

The dual pressures of navigating the complexities of residential aged care systems while maintaining my other responsibilities have taken a significant toll on my mental health and personal life. Ensuring my parents received appropriate care involved evaluating over 70 facilities, confronting the distress of insufficient options, and coordinating their move – all while working full-time. The ongoing emotional and logistical demands have led to constant feelings of anxiety, exhaustion, and isolation.

Like many Australians, particularly in the 'Sandwich Generation', I am juggling the competing needs of aging parents and dependant children. The system as it stands has left me overwhelmed, evidencing a stark gap in support and resources for caregivers who manage complex family dynamics, mental health struggles, and the practical challenges tied to aged care.

I implore you to champion improved national support for caregivers by backing initiatives that offer accessible mental health services, practical help with caregiving logistics, and substantial reform in aged care. Comprehensive support for caregivers would not only alleviate individual burdens but also significantly reinforce our community's health and cohesion.

Thank you for considering this vital issue.

My name is Noeline Ticchio from Earlwood, and I am deeply engaged in providing care for my 97-year-old mother-in-law, Margherita Ticchio. Following the passing of her husband, our family has restructured our lives to support her daily. My role predominantly revolves around managing her medical appointments and medications. The emotional and physical demands of her care, especially as she struggles with dementia, have significantly strained our family dynamic.

The care my husband and his brothers provide requires one of them to be with her every hour of each day, which has had a profound impact on our personal lives, particularly in spending precious moments with our seven grandchildren. This constant juggling between responsibilities is a pervasive challenge, and any alleviation of this burden would be a lifeline to our family.

Like many Australians in similar situations, additional support in navigating health, aged care, and home care services would be incredibly beneficial. This support would not only help in managing our complex family dynamics but also ensure that Margherita receives the best care possible.

I urge you to advocate for increased assistance and resources for families like ours, who are part of the 'Sandwich Generation,' caring for elderly parents while still supporting their own children and grandchildren. The endorsement of national programs such as Violet’s, focused on providing guidance and practical aid, would be crucial.

Your support in developing these resources can transform the lives of countless Australian families, making a significant and heartfelt difference as we care for our ageing loved ones.

I am writing to share my experiences as a caregiver and to highlight the challenges faced by adults like myself, who are juggling the responsibilities of raising children and caring for aged parents. My father, now in his 80s, resides in a regional area and requires increasing levels of support due to his age and health issues. Currently, I manage his needs from a distance, organising delivery of necessities and coordinating his care with my siblings, which often results in friction due to differing views and capacities to help.

The remotest challenges in ensuring my father has the care he needs compound the emotional toll and the coordination efforts required. He lives in penury, and the task of planning for his end-of-life care is daunting, more so without adequate support systems in place for families like ours in rural regions.

This situation is pressing as it not only impacts our elderly parents but also affects the wellbeing of caregivers who are striving to maintain balance in their personal and professional lives. I represent many Australians caught in similar predicaments, often referred to as the ‘Sandwich Generation’, who urgently need better support mechanisms.

I urge you to advocate for the development and funding of comprehensive caregiver support programs on a national level, tailored to the unique challenges faced by families in rural and remote areas. Enhanced support can greatly assist in managing the multifaceted pressures of caregiving, provide relief in coordinating end-of-life care, and improve the quality of life for our elderly, ensuring they are cared for with dignity and compassion.

My name is Melissa, and I am writing to you not only as a resident of your constituency but as a daughter deeply embedded in the care of my elderly parents, Kathleen and John, aged 86 and 84 respectively. Over the past few years, my role as their primary caregiver has intensified, demanding my presence and assistance five days a week. This commitment has constrained my employment opportunities, limiting me to part-time remote work that covers just 20 hours per week. The emotional and physical toll of watching my parents' health decline is increasingly overwhelming, and I often find myself at a loss for support and guidance.

Living in Earlwood, I face the added challenge of limited local resources and support services for elder care, which exacerbates the stress and isolation experienced by many caregivers in similar situations across Australia. The most pressing need for me is a better system to navigate health, aged care, and home care services effectively, which currently seems fragmented and inaccessible.

Therefore, I am urging you to support the national implementation of Violet’s program. This initiative promises to provide caregivers like myself with crucial support, including practical guidance on navigating the complex aged care system and emotional support to manage our challenging roles.

Our ageing population is a growing concern, and without adequate support structures, many of us juggle care with emotional burnout and financial instability. By endorsing Violet's program, you will be taking a significant step toward ensuring that Australians like me can provide the best care for our loved ones without losing ourselves in the process.

My name is Tracy Davidson from Bexley, NSW. Recently, my role in life has taken on a profound shift as I find myself transitioning from just a daughter to a full-time caregiver for my 87-year-old father, Bob. This change has dramatically restructured not only my life but also the essential balance within my family.

Caring for my father consumes over 60 hours every week, a commitment that led me to forego my professional career. The repercussions extend beyond financial loss; they strain my relationships with my husband, children, and grandchildren. The intense focus on my father's needs deprives us of cherished family interactions and my own personal independence, making everyday feel like a repeating loop where personal aspirations are sidelined.

The toughest part of this journey has been the emotional distress of missing vital moments with my loved ones and the creeping isolation that carers often experience. As someone deeply entrenched in these daily challenges, I am acutely aware of the need for improved support systems that specifically address the emotional, logistical, and financial aspects of caregiving.

Thus, I strongly urge you to advocate for increased funding and support for national programs like Violet's, aimed at aiding those in the sandwich generation who balance caring for elderly parents with personal and professional responsibilities. This support would not only uplift carers but also ensure more dignified and compassionate arrangements for the elderly.

My name is Olga De Guzman Soriano, living in the 2606 postcode area. Alongside being a nurse doing shift work, I am a mother to a teenage son who requires ongoing guidance and support.

Balancing shift work with parenting has been extraordinarily challenging. Due to my work schedule, I am often absent most of the week, which strains our relationship and diminishes the quality time I can spend with him. This absence is felt deeply, as it is crucial for me to be present during these formative years to provide stability and guidance.

The lack of presence impacts our family dynamics, particularly when stress levels rise, and disagreements occur. Support in managing family dynamics effectively would greatly alleviate the pressure faced during such critical times.

I'm Kristina Tolhurst from Canberra, reaching out to share my journey as a caregiver for my 84-year-old mother, Indira, who was diagnosed with dementia this year. Recently relocated from Sydney to be with me, my role in her life has dramatically shifted—coordinating her appointments, managing finances, and fulfilling daily needs. Dementia has reshaped her perception of reality, often leading her to confabulate events, which has proven to be both confusing and emotionally draining for me.

As an only child, the sole responsibility of her care rests on my shoulders. On average, I dedicate more than five hours weekly to her well-being, amid balancing work and my own family. This has taken a significant toll on my mental health, occasionally straining my patience not just with my mother, but also with my husband and children.

The most challenging aspect is navigating the complicated terrain of health and aged care services, a task compounded by my mum's condition and our geographical distance from Sydney’s more plentiful resources. Support in this area would be incredibly beneficial, not just for me but for many Australians in similar situations.

I entreat you to advocate for the national support and enhancement of entities like Violet’s national program.

I provide care for multiple family members with diverse needs, including veteran issues and oncology-related conditions. The responsibilities are vast and often intensified by cycles of remission and recurrence, with the backdrop of a deeply nuanced human rights landscape.

The most arduous part of this role is contending with gendered assumptions in care situations and professional biases that overlook the true complexity of our family dynamics. My efforts extend beyond physical care; they involve safeguarding rights, navigating identity concerns, and often, managing strained family relations under difficult circumstances.

Living in Wahroonga, NSW and managing his increasingly demanding care 24/7 have been profoundly challenging without any support from the NDIS, due to Edwin’s New Zealand citizenship on a Non-Protected Special Category Visa. This has left us, law-abiding and tax-paying residents of Australia for nearly two decades, unsupported, financially strained, and personally overwhelmed as I watch the progressive loss of the man I once knew.

My name is Sally-May Schinkel, and I am currently the primary caregiver for my 85-year-old mother, Barbara Ann Thomas. Over recent years, caring for my mother has involved managing frequent doctor visits across three cities and handling sudden hospitalisations. The complexity and intensity of her care demands have escalated to a point where it recently culminated in a significant personal breakdown, severely straining our family relations across four generations.

The hardest part of this journey has been witnessing the disintegration of close family ties. Our recent conflicts over care decisions have led to a complete breakdown in communication; siblings and cousins are no longer in contact, profoundly affecting the fabric of our extended family.

Living in a regional location, 4312, compounds these challenges, making it difficult to access timely medical and support services, which often exacerbates health emergencies. The logistical and emotional burden of rural caregiving cannot be understated, and support systems in such areas urgently need strengthening.

I am writing to implore your support for national initiatives like Violet's program, which aim to provide comprehensive guidance and support to caregivers. Strengthening such programs will not only aid caregivers like myself in navigating health and aged care systems but will also provide essential emotional support to keep families like mine from falling apart.

Improved caregiver support is crucial as our population ages. I kindly ask you to advocate for policies that support caregivers nationally, ensuring that no one has to endure the hardships of caregiving alone.

Yours sincerely,

My name is Shell Rossi, and I live in the quiet suburb of Ipswich, postcode 4305. At 76, my mum requires constant attention and care, a responsibility I manage daily alongside my personal and professional commitments. Managing the expectations of being a sufficient caregiver while keeping up with life's other demands has been an incredible challenge.

The hardest part is reconciling the expectation of providing exceptional care with the reality of my capabilities and resources. My mum and I could benefit immensely from clearer guidance on navigating health, aged care, and home care services. Every visit to my mum is aimed at ensuring her well-being, yet each encounter underscores the complexities of accessing consistent support, particularly in regional areas like ours where resources are often stretched thin.

In light of this, I implore you to advocate for Violet’s national program which promises to offer essential support to caregivers like myself. The program’s commitment to provide practical assistance and emotional support would be a lifeline, helping us to navigate the multifaceted challenges of aged care more effectively.

Australia’s aging population needs a robust support system for caregivers nationwide, ensuring that we can continue to look after our loved ones without sacrificing our health and livelihoods. Your support for this program will not merely ease the burden on families but will ensure our elderly receive the care and dignity they deserve.

Thank you for considering this critical issue. Your action can make a real difference to many lives across our country.

Over the past few years, my role has evolved into providing 24/7 care, attending to every aspect of his daily life from administering medication to meals, personal hygiene, and general companionship.

Living in Smithfield, postcode 2164, and caring for my father alone has presented significant challenges, particularly as he battles with mental health issues, expressing frequent anger and frustration. These emotional upheavals take a toll, not only on him but on me as well, impacting my ability to manage other responsibilities.

The hardest part of this journey has been handling these intense emotional fluctuations and the constant worry about planning for the final stages of his life. Support in this area, particularly aimed at caregivers in rural or remote locations like ours, where resources are sparse, would be invaluable.

I am appealing to your compassion and understanding to advocate for increased support and resources for caregivers across the country. Programs like Violet's national program offer a beacon of hope, providing essential guidance and support that could greatly ease the burdens faced by many Australians in similar situations.

My name is Lynnie Shaw and I am currently the primary caregiver for my 82-year-old aunty, Gwen, who lives with me in Smithfield, NSW. Over the past few years, my role has evolved significantly, dealing not only with the physical demands of caregiving but also with an immense emotional and social toll. Each week, I dedicate over 20 hours to assist Gwen, which deeply affects my personal freedom and has led to considerable emotional strain, including episodes of depression that have required professional counselling.

Living in a regional area adds another layer of complexity to our situation. The limited availability of specialised health services makes daily management and emergency situations particularly challenging. Additionally, the sense of isolation can be overwhelming at times, both for Gwen and myself.

One critical support that could alleviate our situation is having guided conversations about options and decisions for future care needs. This assistance could considerably reduce the emotional burden and provide clarity in our decision-making processes.

I am reaching out to ask for your support for strengthening resources and assistance for family caregivers across Australia, particularly through initiatives like Violet’s national program. Such support would not only provide practical and emotional support but could also offer crucial guidance in navigating aged care services, which is particularly needed in rural and regional areas like ours.

By championing improved support for caregivers, together we can ensure that Australians like Gwen receive the compassionate care they deserve, while their caregivers are supported rather than overwhelmed.

My name is Fiona Johnson, and I live in the suburb of Greystanes, with my elderly father. Over the past few years, my role in his life has transitioned significantly—I've gone from being just his daughter to his primary caregiver. This change came about more urgently as my mother, his long-time carer, passed away. Now, alongside managing a full-time job, I am responsible for his daily care and well-being, a role both physically and emotionally taxing.

Living in a non-metropolitan area such as ours adds layers of complexity to accessing sufficient health, aged care, and home care services. The rural setting, while peaceful, often means fewer immediate resources and extended travel times for medical appointments, significantly impacting our quality of life and the care I can provide.

The hardest part of this journey has been seeing the toll it takes not only on my father but on myself as well, as I juggle these responsibilities with my personal and professional life. Reliable, easily accessible support would greatly improve our situation by providing guidance on navigating the complex systems surrounding aged care, and practical help at home.

Therefore, I am urging you to advocate for the support of Violet's national program, which promises to provide crucial assistance and resources to caregivers like myself. This support would address the unique challenges faced by those in rural settings and serve as a backbone for Australians in similar positions across the nation.

As her condition deteriorates, my role as a caregiver intensifies, posing significant challenges not only to my emotional health but also in maintaining harmony within my family.

The reality of watching my mum lose fragments of her memory is painful. Yet, amidst this sorrow, I strive to remain a pillar of strength and positivity for my children. Balancing the profound emotional demands of caregiving with the everyday responsibilities of family life is becoming increasingly overwhelming.

I am writing to you both as a constituent and a daughter who is navigating the immense challenges of caregiving. My mother, Heather Shepherd, has recently been diagnosed with two forms of dementia. As her only child, the responsibility of supporting her falls to me. This comes amidst managing a business, running a charity, and caring for my own family, including three children with special needs and aging in-laws nearing homelessness.

The task of caring for my mother is daunting, not only because of our strained relationship stemming from past family issues but also due to the increasing demands of her condition. The lack of respite and the burden of making critical decisions alone—without guidance or adequate support—compounds the daily stress. I find myself stretched thin, fighting to balance professional responsibilities with personal crises, all while ensuring the welfare of several family members.

The needs of caregivers like myself are immediate and significant. Key areas where support could make an instrumental difference include facilitating crucial conversations, navigating health and aged care services, and managing family dynamics under stress.

This role, as you can imagine, is not only physically demanding but also emotionally taxing. The responsibility brings daily frustrations and has made me acutely aware of the profound impact caregiving has on one's life.

The hardest part of my experience is the constant strain it puts on my ability to enjoy life's simple pleasures and maintain social connections, which are vital as we age. I find myself often in need of support to have crucial conversations about future care options and decisions that weigh heavily on me.

Over the past few years, my life has transformed as I've become not just a daughter, but a full-time carer overseeing all aspects of my mother's life—from medical appointments to managing finances and household duties. This role shift has left little room for quality time with her,with my family or even for myself.

The responsibility of caring has significantly impacted my workload, affecting my family and mental health due to the relentless nature of the tasks and the difficulty in getting clear assistance from government agencies.

At 88, my mother requires increasingly comprehensive care, a responsibility that falls on me alongside my other duties. This juggling act of work, family, and caregiving is pushing me to my limits.

As my mother ages, her needs deepen, and so does the complexity of our situation. The hardest part? Trying to maintain a balance—ensuring I give adequate attention to my career, which sustains us financially, and to my family, while also managing the escalating care demands of my mother. This triad of responsibilities is not unique to me but is a shared reality for many in what's known as the Sandwich Generation.

My father, Girts Eric Parups, aged 86, struggles with Alzheimer's and dementia, requiring constant support and attention. My mother, Joyce Helga Parups, aged 85, is fighting breast cancer alongside other health and mobility issues. These circumstances compel me to balance caregiving duties with managing my own family’s needs and professional responsibilities, often leaving me stretched thin across all fronts.

Each week, I dedicate three to four days to ensure my parents' well-being, coordinating medical appointments, and managing their intricate care needs. As their conditions have rapidly advanced, the impact on my physical, emotional, and financial well-being has intensified profoundly. Managing work alongside the growing caretaking demands has become increasingly daunting.

I care for both of my parents, Judith and Dean Achmad, aged 76 and 78 respectively. In recent years, their dependence on me has increased significantly. My father is emotionally fragile due to my mother’s onset of dementia. In addition to this, I am responsible for supporting my daughter, a single parent, and her two children, while holding down a full-time job.

The daily demands range from sorting out my parents’ correspondence, ensuring they have social interaction, to emotional support, often extending to intensive caregiving over the weekends. The hardest part of my experience is coping with mental and emotional exhaustion while still awaiting my mother's assessment, which has left us without the necessary support.

The responsibilities of the so-called ‘Sandwich Generation’ are growing, as they balance caring for elderly parents and their own children.

In recent years, my caregiving role has evolved significantly due to becoming a single mother in a challenging situation involving an abusive ex-partner. This shift has not only impacted our family dynamic but also my ability to effectively manage our lives without the support we desperately need.

Caring for my son demands constant attention and significant resources, particularly concerning childcare. The financial strain of childcare, coupled with the emotional toll of dealing with a contentious family law system, has proven extremely challenging. The system's focus seems to weigh heavily on paternal involvement without considering the adverse effects of an abusive relationship on the child and the caregiving parent.

First, an improvement in legal and welfare systems that recognises the nuances of abusive relationships and prioritises the wellbeing of the child and the primary caregiver over forced relational bonds. Second, more accessible and financially viable childcare options that consider the caregivers' employment constraints and emotional state.

I urge you to advocate for broader, more nuanced support for single parents like myself, faced with abusive relationships and significant childcare costs. A statutory reform that prioritises the child's and primary caregiver's wellbeing in family law decisions and improved financial and institutional support for childcare would make a substantial difference.

My name is Caryn McKeon and I am writing to share my personal experience and seek your support for enhanced caregiver support across Australia. I care for my father who has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As his condition progresses, the responsibilities I hold multiply, impacting every aspect of my life.

Living in Mullum, a suburb faced with its own set of challenges particularly in accessing immediate and specialised healthcare, my role in Dad’s life has drastically shifted to a more active caring position. I see him every couple of days, managing medications, appointments, and daily well-being—all while juggling my own family and work commitments. The unpredictability of Dad’s behaviour, a direct result of his condition, is among the hardest parts of my caregiving journey.

The rural context of our area compounds these challenges, making it difficult to access the consistent medical and support services needed for Alzheimer's care. Furthermore, the emotional toll and logistical strains are palpable and I continuously find myself grappling with feelings of being overwhelmed and lost.

A national program like Violet’s, designed to provide not only practical guides but also crucial emotional support and assistance in navigating aged and home care services, would be invaluable. Such support would not only assist families like mine but also ensure that as our population ages, no Australian, regardless of where they live, lacks the care or support they need.

I urge you to advocate for the enhancement of caregiver support mechanisms nationally, ensuring that those of us in the critical roles of caring for aging parents are not left to manage alone. Our community and our country can only benefit from a well-supported, well-prepared aging population.

My name is Kellie Lean, and I write to you today not just on behalf of myself but on behalf of many Australians caught in the challenging role of caring for elderly parents while managing other life commitments. I am the primary caregiver for my 85-year-old mother, Jill Dillon, who resides with me in Armadale, WA 6112. Over the years, as my mother's needs have intensified, so have the demands on my time and energy.

Each day presents new challenges that I struggle to navigate, from ensuring my mother's health and wellbeing to managing her appointments and daily needs. I admit, I am often tired, and my patience wears thin. The emotional toll is significant, and it impacts not just me but also the quality of care I can provide.

What would truly make a difference for me is streamlined access to health, aged care, and home care services. However, as vital as these services are, they are challenging to navigate, particularly in our regional setting where resources are often limited or stretched thin.

I urge you to consider supporting funding for Violet's national program. This initiative promises to offer practical guidance, emotional support, and crucial navigation assistance through the maze of aged care services. Such support would not only uplift caregivers like myself but also enhance the quality of care our elderly loved ones receive.

We are in dire need of a system that supports both the aging population and those who care for them. Please advocate for better caregiver support on a national level to ensure no one has to face these overwhelming challenges alone.

My name is Michelle Lee, and I am writing to you from my home in postcode 6076 where I care full-time for my 86-year-old father and three young grandchildren aged 4, 5, and 7. My two adult sons also live with us, and I must admit, juggling the demands of two generations in my care leaves me with no time for self-care.

My situation, I believe, resonates with the 'Sandwich Generation,' many of whom are tirelessly balancing the needs of aging parents with commitments to their own children. The emotional and financial toll it takes to manage day-to-day life, alongside differing family dynamics and stress, is immense. Without external support, I confess that I often feel more like a service provider than a family member.

Critical support that would make a substantial difference for many of us in this situation includes help in managing family dynamics, especially during high-stress times, and alignment when family members disagree on care approaches. Moreover, residing in a regional area complicates access to specialised resources and professional assistance even further, which can be isolating and overwhelming.

Thus, I urge you to strongly advocate for Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to provide not just logistical support but crucial emotional backing and practical tools to navigate aged care services effectively. Establishing stronger support systems for both the elderly and their family caregivers is vital as our population continues to age.

Let’s ensure no one in our community has to face these challenges without the support they desperately need.

I am Sharon Properjohn, a resident in the community of Harrisdale, reaching out in a state of deep concern and urgency regarding my current situation and the broader plight of individuals in similar circumstances across Australia. I am currently responsible for navigating the complexities of aged care without any external support, facing the daunting task of ensuring a dignified final stage of life for loved ones who are utterly dependent on me.

In recent years, the weight of this responsibility has been crushing. Without formal assistance or guidance, I endure an overwhelming sense of isolation and abandonment. The statement I am ‘left to die’ resonates painfully not in terms of physical care but in a systemic neglect of my emotional and practical needs as a carer.

The absence of accessible support systems has left me and others in rural and remote areas particularly vulnerable. We struggle not only with the day-to-day physical demands of caregiving but also with an acute lack of resources specific to our unique circumstances. This issue is especially critical in non-metropolitan regions where specialised services are sparse and often unable to cater to our specific needs.

I urge you and your colleagues to advocate for and support the implementation of Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to alleviate some of the burdens by offering practical guidance, emotional support, and crucial resources to effectively navigate aged care services. Supporting this program would represent a significant step towards ensuring that no Australian carer has to feel they are navigating these tremendous challenges alone.

This action would not only transform individual lives but would resonate across communities, supporting our ageing population with the dignity and care they deserve.

I am writing to share my personal experience and advocate for stronger support systems around elderly care. At 58, I am a primary caregiver for my aged parents, both in their late 70s, who’ve bravely battled cancer and now face escalating health and administrative demands. Despite the love and devotion we give to our seniors, the challenges are multiplying, especially in managing their technology needs and protecting them from ever-increasing scams.

My parents require frequent in-person assistance, which pulls me away from my own family and health management. My father's mental decline has put additional pressures on my mother and myself, leading to constant advocacy on our behalf to secure basic services and protect them from being exploited. Unfortunately, the current systems leave much to be desired in terms of accessibility and sensitivity to the ageing population's unique needs.

I urge you to consider endorsing and campaigning for more support for caregivers like myself, especially those managing the balance of care in rural or remote areas, where services can be even harder to coordinate. Programs that assist in navigating health, aged care, and associated administrative tasks would be invaluable. We need a robust strategy that doesn't just tackle the practicalities of elderly care but also addresses the emotional and financial burdens on families.

The introduction of a nationally coordinated program, such as the proposed Violet’s national program, would be a significant step forward in providing the necessary support and resources for caregivers across Australia. It would help alleviate the strain on families and ensure our elderly are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

Thank you for considering this crucial issue. Your support could dramatically improve the quality of life for countless Australians.

I’m writing to share my story and seek your support on an issue close to my heart and home. My name is Debbie Zwickl from Lesmurdie, and I share the caring with my siblings for my 92-year-old mother, Jean. Since my father's passing three years ago, Jean's wellbeing has become our responsibility. My days involve constant coordination of her needs—from daily phone calls to weekly in-person visits and spontaneous needs for transport for her appointments and errands.

The hardest part of this journey is seeing my mother continuously unhappy and feeling helpless in improving her emotional state. This not only takes a toll on her but deeply affects me and my family, often making me distracted and emotionally stretched.

Caring for an elderly parent as Jean’s state of mind deteriorates and she misses my Dad deeply, has reshaped my life. It is a 24/7 commitment that leaves little room for respite, and I believe my experience mirrors that of many Australians today. The sandwich generation, of which I am a part, needs structured support to manage this dual caring role.

This is why I strongly advocate for your support for a national program like Violet's. This program could offer crucial guidance and support for caregivers by helping us navigate the complexities of elderly care, including essential emotional support and end-of-life planning. Such initiatives would not only help caregivers but also provide our ageing population with the dignity they deserve.

I urge you to consider how pivotal such programs are for improving the quality of life for both caregivers and those we care for. Your advocacy for better caregiver support can make a profound difference to families like mine across Australia.

I'm writing to you not just on behalf of my family, but as a representative voice for countless Australians enduring similar challenges. My days are primarily spent caring for two elderly individuals who have become my world—Elsie Osborne and Daniel Carroll. Managing Elsie's needs in her battle with dementia while accommodating Daniel's multiple sclerosis is a profound commitment. Their conditions bring not only physical demands but also emotional and mental burdens, with their frustrations often directed towards me, leading to an aggressive and abusive environment.

These roles have evolved significantly, necessitating me to act more as a nurse than just a carer. This shift has placed an immense strain on my personal health, well-being, and ability to manage other life responsibilities. The isolation felt in our community, especially being in a remote area, exacerbates these challenges, with limited access to specialised care and support systems.

What would substantially change our lives is streamlined, accessible support in navigating health, aged care, and home care services. Therefore, I am urging you to advocate for the funding of Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to provide essential guidance, emotional support, and practical aid to individuals like myself, who are relentlessly trying to balance the scales of caregiving, personal health, and familial duties.

Your support for this program could bring significant relief and resources to families grappling with the complexities of elderly care, particularly in rural regions. Please help us look forward to a future where we can care for our loved ones without sacrificing our own health and happiness.

My name is Sharon Properjohn from the suburb 6112. Although I am not currently caring for anyone, the thought of preparing for the end-of-life care for my loved ones often weighs heavily on my mind. Many Australians, like me, face anxiety over these future responsibilities, particularly concerned with how we can manage these crucial stages compassionately and effectively.

Anticipating the need for end-of-life care without clear guidance or support can be daunting. The lack of resources and knowledge about the available support systems adds to the substantial emotional toll this future task imposes. Planning for end-of-life care is not only a personal issue but a national concern, especially as we see a demographic shift towards an aging population in Australia.

In light of these concerns, I urge you to advocate and support Violet's national program. This vital initiative offers practical guidance and emotional support and assists Australians in navigating the complexities of aged care services. Programs like these are crucial in providing peace of mind and preparedness for individuals and families facing the sensitive last stages of life.

I kindly request your support in promoting better national policies and programs that cater to the nuanced needs of preparing for aged care. Initiatives such as this are not just beneficial, they are necessary to ensure that all Australians can approach this challenging phase of life with confidence and dignity.

My name is Jules, and I am currently the primary caregiver for both my own parents and my in-laws. As someone with increasing disability needs myself—as yet unmet and unsupported due to eligibility criteria—I find balancing care for both myself and our elderly family extremely challenging.

Living in an area postcode 6110, I constantly negotiate and advocate for my family to utilise community services, which they are often reluctant to embrace. This burden significantly impacts my health, having resulted in multiple hospital admissions due to my conditions, including osteoporosis and spinal degeneration, exacerbated by low blood pressure causing frequent falls.

The emotional and physical toll of caregiving, compounded by my own health issues, is overwhelming. The toughest part of this journey is the isolation in being the sole family member providing support. My parents have frequent falls and tell hospital staff that I am their carer—even comparing my health issues, I face greater physical challenges, yet access to adequate homecare or aged care packages remains beyond my reach until I reach the qualifying age or disability level.

This situation underscores the urgent need for a more inclusive, supportive system for caregivers like myself, especially in regional areas where services can be sparse and difficult to access. I am writing to urge you to advocate for and support the implementation of Violet's national program. Such an initiative would provide essential support, navigation tools, and resources for caregivers across Australia, recognising and addressing the unique challenges faced by rural caregivers and those ineligible for existing support systems due to age or disability thresholds.

Your support for this program would not only change the lives of countless Australians like myself but also acknowledge and address the growing needs of an ageing population that relies heavily on family caregivers.

My name is Elizabeth Elwell-Cook, and I am writing to you from my home in Portland 2847, where I care for five family members, including my elderly parents and my disabled husband. Each week, I dedicate up to 60 hours to managing their health and aged care needs, on top of maintaining what I can of a demanding academic career, reduced to two days a week, just to keep a roof over our heads since the Carer Pension is not enough, and I cannot access Carer Allowance for my pensioner  parents, who live 50km away.

The dual responsibility of supporting my family while trying to preserve my professional life has brought significant challenges. The delay in securing aged care packages, the complexity of navigating NDIS and MyAged Care systems, coupled with my own health issues, have stretched my capacity to its limits. My efforts to secure a permanent university position are dwindling as my PhD remains incomplete, impacting our financial security and professional stability.

Living in a regional area only amplifies these challenges, with services and support significantly harder to access, leading to isolation and the loss of friendships. The relentless nature of my responsibilities continued even when I contracted COVID, highlighting the acute lack of respite and support available to caregivers like me.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced support for caregivers nationwide, focusing on those in rural and regional areas. Implementing more efficient aged care services and better caregiver support would significantly impact our ability to manage our responsibilities without sacrificing our health and livelihoods.

This oversight has not only exacerbated their condition but has also placed immense strain on the safety, functioning, and wellbeing of our family.

Living in a regional area, like postcode 2614, compounds these challenges, as access to specialised psychiatric and therapeutic support is limited. Our family dynamics are teetering on the edge, as we are caught in a relentless cycle of stress and disagreement over care strategies and interventions.

The most harrowing part of this role has been witnessing the perpetuation of harmful intergenerational behaviours, which have been inadequately addressed due to a constrained view on mental health that fails to provide holistic and integrative treatment approaches. Seeing a loved one favour their immediate comfort over the long-term wellbeing of their children and family continues to be distressing.

The most strenuous aspect of my caregiving journey is indeed the sheer volume of time required – time that detracts significantly from other important life areas, including my career and personal well-being. One of the immediate supports that would immensely benefit individuals like myself is better guidance on health, aged care, and home care services. The current systems are complex and navigating them often feels like a full-time job in itself.

In light of this, I urge your support for Violet’s national program, which aims to provide caregivers with necessary resources, emotional support, and practical guidance to navigate aged care services effectively. This initiative would not only aid in enhancing the quality of life for our elderly but also significantly alleviate the pressures faced by caregivers across the country, thereby enabling them to maintain a balanced life.

I trust you recognise the urgency and the profound impact your advocacy could have on this matter and sincerely hope you will consider promoting this vital program. Enhanced support systems are crucial as our population continues to age, and your leadership in this issue could make a meaningful difference.

My name is April Kingsbury, a 64-year-old from Dawesville, WA, sharing a rental house with my 83-year-old mother, Dawn. Facing both the demands of caregiving and the harsh realities of potential poverty as I myself age, I reach out for your support on a matter pressing to so many Australians in similar positions.

Recently, caregiving for my mother, who fell during the pandemic and relies on her pension to cover only her share of our rent, has intensified. As her only carer, I manage our home, our finances, and her extensive needs single-handedly. Beyond the physical chores of cleaning and gardening, my role includes full-time emotional and administrative support, leaving me drained and worried about our future security and wellbeing.

The most challenging aspect of this journey has been the harsh impact on my aspirations and fears of impending poverty. The emotional toll and financial strain are immense, and support systems that aid in planning and managing the last stages of life for our loved ones are desperately needed.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced backing for programs like Violet’s national initiative, which promises practical, financial, and emotional support for caregivers. As Australia’s population ages, supporting the 'Sandwich Generation'—those of us caring for aging parents while balancing personal and financial vulnerabilities—is crucial.

Your advocacy can champion the development of resources that ensure no Australian caregiver has to face these challenges without substantial support.

Thank you for considering this vital issue that affects so many of your constituents.

My name is Karen Stalker and I am writing to you from the suburb of Mandurah, postcode 6210. I am devotedly caring for my 75-year-old mother, Dawn, who has recently faced significant declines in health and mobility. The challenges of navigating the care system, combined with my role as her sole caregiver and balancing work and my own family responsibilities, are overwhelming to say the least.

Over the past few years, my mother's condition has necessitated frequent hospitalisation and constant medical care. This has forced me to take unpaid leave from my part-time job, significantly affecting our financial stability. Unfortunately, I do not qualify for a carer's allowance or any other form of assistance, leaving me in a precarious position where I am stretched thin on all fronts.

The emotional and physical toll of becoming a parent to my own mother, watching her struggle and trying to coordinate with health services without adequate support, cannot be overstated. Each day brings with it not just logistical challenges but profound emotional weight, impacting not only our wellbeing but also our relationship.

The assistance from a comprehensive support system such as Violet’s national program would be indispensable to me. Such a program could offer practical guidance and emotional support, aiding caregivers like myself in navigating the complex landscape of health, aged care, and home care services effectively.

I implore you to advocate for enhanced national support for caregivers, ensuring that we are equipped to provide the best care possible while maintaining our health, careers, and family life. It is crucial that as our population ages, robust support systems are in place to uphold the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers who dedicate themselves to this demanding role.

This role has unfolded while I am managing full-time employment and supporting my father, who is unfamiliar with digital technologies required for organising our day-to-day life.

Each day, I find myself juggling my professional responsibilities with the need to manage my mother's paperwork, coordinate with carers, and handle various family logistical needs. The greatest difficulty lies in the exhaustion and strain of ensuring all these tasks are completed effectively—there never seems to be enough time.

Living in a regional area like ours in postcode 6124 complicates access to specialised health, aged care, and home care services, making it crucial to have more streamlined support systems. Guidance on how best to navigate these systems would be invaluable, not just for my peace of mind but also to enhance the quality of care my mother receives.

Therefore, I sincerely urge you to support the implementation of a national program like Violet’s. This program would provide not just practical assistance in aged care management but also emotional support for families like mine who are increasingly bearing the brunt of caregiving responsibilities.

My name is Mariana Hurtado, and I am writing to you from my home in 6210, where I am the primary caregiver for my wife, Myreesa. Following a severe car accident and a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, Myreesa's physical abilities have significantly deteriorated, necessitating constant care and attention.

Over the past few years, the demands of caring for her have drastically increased. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which is intended to provide support, has unfortunately become a source of great difficulty, leaving us without adequate funding for essential services such as respite care. This lack of support not only affects my ability to work and continue my studies but also places immense strain on both my physical and mental health.

Most distressingly, the situation has led to me witnessing Myreesa come close to death on multiple occasions due to inadequate care and funding. Watching the person I love struggle daily is heartbreaking, and it is evident that the current system is failing us.

I am reaching out to request your support for enhanced national caregiver support programs. More specifically, initiatives that ensure caregivers and their loved ones receive the necessary assistance to manage health, aged care, and home care services effectively. Programs need to be streamlined and made more accessible to prevent scenarios like ours from becoming the norm.

Let us ensure that the systems designed to help do not become obstacles themselves. I ask that you advocate within Parliament for the vital improvements needed in our national care support infrastructure.

My name is Karen Johnson-Gibson from Mandurah, postcode 6210, navigating the extensive responsibilities of caring for four elderly parents while juggling my role as a relief teacher and supporting my 21-year-old daughter who battles with anxiety. My parents and parents-in-law are in their late 70s and early 80s, facing the loss of independence that leads to profound frustration and occasional aggressiveness. They reside in a place where resources, especially for those in rural areas, are becoming increasingly scarce.

The support provided by institutions such as Carers WA, while invaluable, is stretched thin. The limited time allocated for essential services like cleaning and social support does not meet the needs of elderly individuals in larger homes attached to their lifetime collections of belongings, which pose safety risks. My weekly visits involve cleaning up before the cleaner arrives, preparing meals, and managing numerous medical appointments. These responsibilities significantly encroach on the personal and economic aspects of my life, impacting the time I can dedicate to my husband and my job.

The hardest part is the emotional toll. There is a sense of mourning for the changing dynamics with my parents and a lack of empathy for the sparse personal time remaining for myself and my husband. Banks and other services withdrawing personalised support and the closure of local services only exacerbate our struggles.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced national support for caregivers like me facing these dual pressures. We need a comprehensive approach that includes more substantial home support and resources for critical conversations about ageing and integrated care strategies. This support would not only aid caregivers but also respect and dignify our elderly's desire to safely age in their homes.

Recently, my father was moved to a care facility, and the responsibilities of supporting my increasingly dependent mother have intensified. Simultaneously, I am striving to grow my own business and manage the complexities of my son’s needs.

The dual pressures of ensuring my mother does not make impulsive, chaotic decisions, alongside catering to my son's unique requirements, weigh heavily on my husband and myself. The struggle to keep a professional and personal life afloat amidst these demands is immeasurably challenging. It often feels like navigating a relentless storm without a compass.

The reality for many caregivers in our community, especially in areas with limited access to immediate and diverse support services, is one of isolation and insufficient aid. What would significantly change the lives of individuals like myself is robust, accessible support that recognises and caters to the unique challenges faced by 'Sandwich Generation' caregivers—those of us caught between caring for our parents and our children.

I urge you to endorse and advocate for the expansion of Violet’s national program. This initiative promises not only to provide practical guidance but also crucial emotional support and assistance in navigating the complex landscape of aged care services.

My name is Karen Jayne and I reside in the suburb 6211. I'm nearing 60 and have adopted the role of a caregiver for a dear friend, also named Karen. Despite previous aims for a romantic relationship, the evolving circumstances have instead designated me as her primary support, due to her lack of family or close friends.

Caring for Karen encompasses assisting with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, meal preparation, and medication management. One of the most heart-wrenching aspects of my role has been witnessing her gradual decline, feeling isolated in our challenges because it seems that not enough people truly care about our plight.

Living in a regional location compounds these difficulties by limited access to specialised support services which could alleviate some of the emotional and practical burdens we face daily. More resources for managing complex family dynamics and caregiver stress specifically tailored to those of us in less urban areas would be markedly beneficial.

The challenge of balancing my career and familial duties consumes nearly all my time and emotional energy. Each week, I strive to ensure my father's needs for food and shopping are met, alongside my other responsibilities. This balancing act is creating an intense strain not just on me, but also on our family dynamics, particularly in times of stress or disagreement among relatives about the best ways forward.

I write to you as a caregiver deeply entrenched in the daily management of complex health and personal care for two loved ones, underscoring a critical gap in our community support systems. My sister, aged 60, and partner, aged 64, rely heavily on my help for everyday living skills, medication management, and mental health support due to their inability to care for themselves and a recent escape from domestic violence.

Navigating our healthcare system from our home in the postcode 4703 with its limited resources has been a formidable challenge, especially as my loved ones fall into a support gap – too young for Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT) and hindered by the complex process of accessing the NDIS.

The emotional and physical toll this role takes is substantial; managing multiple appointments and ensuring basic needs are met, all without sufficient financial resources or external support, is draining. The hardest part, however, is the feeling of isolation and the fear of what future holds without additional help.

There is a dire need for community programs that cater to individuals like us, especially in rural and regional areas where services are stretched thin. I urge you to support the expansion of funding for national caregiver programs. Such initiatives would provide not only practical guidance and relief but also ensure that caregivers are not left to manage these overwhelming responsibilities alone.

The daily demands of my role have significantly ramped up over recent years, leaving me with virtually no personal time and impacting my overall wellbeing.

The hardest part of my journey is the constant juggling—balancing my son's needs with my own health and limited resources. While I strive to provide the best care, the absence of a support system makes it difficult to manage the emotional and physical toll it takes.

I manage her care needs at least four days a week due to the significant shortage of employable care staff in our area, postcode 4740. This role has forced me to forgo paid employment, severely impacting my savings for retirement. Additionally, the demanding nature of this support leaves me no time for personal relationships, including maintaining contact with my own family.

The lack of adequate support systems and the constant worry over whether sufficient funding and staffing will be available is overwhelmingly stressful. I am facing these challenges not by choice but by necessity, and the pressure to manage everything without adequate help is unrelenting.

Therefore, I urge you to support and advocate for increased funding and improvement of caregiver support services nationally. We need reliable and effective systems that address the unique challenges faced by rural caregivers, ensuring that no Australian has to sacrifice their well-being and financial security to care for a loved one.

My mother, Carol Jensen, aged 83, has transitioned from being fiercely independent to requiring constant care following health setbacks worsened during the COVID lockdowns. She now lives with us due to significant mobility and cognitive decline.

The shift from daughter to full-time carer while also caring for my three autistic sons, who face their own significant challenges, places me squarely in what is known as the 'Sandwich Generation.'

My mother, Charmaine, aged 73, is grappling with stage 4 bowel cancer and is frequently hospitalised due to severe treatment side effects. During this harrowing time, my disabled father, Jim, aged 75, increasingly relies on my support.

Navigating our healthcare system while maintaining a full-time job and raising a family has caused significant strains both financially and emotionally. I dedicate numerous hours weekly managing care workers, organising medical appointments, and overseeing treatments – time and energy which has begun to jeopardise my employment and has limited my interaction with my children.

Supporting Mum involves daily visits, overnight stays, and managing numerous medical appointments from oncology to dermatology.

I have recently become the full-time carer for my 84-year-old mother, Fran, who battles with severe dementia and is now in residential aged care. Dementia has transformed my once strong-willed and joyful mother into someone who is constantly paranoid, unhappy, and severely confused – a sharp contrast to the woman who once was the light of every family gathering.

For years, I cared for Mum at home, tending to all her needs night and day which barred me from leaving the house without immense worry. Since her condition necessitated professional care, I spend my every afternoon at her side to help her adjust, returning only at bedtime to manage my own family's needs. This relentless cycle has taken a stark toll on my health—I suffered a heart attack earlier this year due to the compounded stress.

I find myself in a constant cycle of repetition and struggle, trying to keep up with the demands of caregiving, which often leaves me feeling overwhelmed and distressed.

The pressure of ensuring I'm providing adequate care while contemplating the prolonged nature of my role is daunting. The hardest part is the feeling of isolation and the fear of the unknown as I consider the future care needs of my parents. The prospect of handling this for potentially another decade or more is immensely challenging.

It is clear that many Australians find themselves in similar predicaments, particularly in rural and regional communities like mine, where access to resources and support services can be limited. Caregivers in these locations face unique challenges, including fewer healthcare options and greater distances to travel for medical appointments.

I urge you to recognise the vital need for comprehensive support systems that can provide relief and guidance to families navigating the care of elderly loved ones. Support with planning for the last stages of life is crucial, not just for the well-being of our aging population but for their caregivers too.

I ask for your advocacy in supporting the funding and implementation of Violet's national program which aims to assist families like mine in managing the complexities of aged care. Your action can help alleviate the burdens faced by countless Australians and provide much-needed peace of mind.

I write to you as both a daughter and a primary advocate for my 90-year-old mother, Agnes Trew, who resides in an independent living setting. Despite the support from a carer's package, I find myself constantly juggling her needs with the demands of my own family life.

Each week, I am responsible for my mother’s grocery shopping, regular welfare checks, and providing the crucial emotional companionship she requires. This role extends well beyond the formal support hours allocated to her, deeply impacting my personal and family life. Managing these responsibilities becomes significantly more challenging due to limited extended family support and the complex dynamics that often arise under such stress.

The struggle to maintain harmony at home while ensuring my mother's well-being is a burden shared by many Australians in similar situations, often referred to as the ‘Sandwich Generation’. We manage the delicate balance of care across generations, often at the cost of our own health and well-being.

Supporting Violet’s national program would provide families like mine with much-needed resources and guidance to better manage these challenges. This program could offer practical and emotional support and advice on navigating aged care services that are crucial for maintaining the mental and emotional health of caregivers across the country. 

I urge you to advocate for increased support and resources for caregivers nationally so families navigating these challenging circumstances can receive the aid they desperately need.

Although I am not yet their primary caregiver, I'm acutely aware of the complexities involved in managing their future health and home care needs, given my background.

Caring for my parents while navigating the services essential for their well-being and dignity will unquestionably strain my capacity to balance work, life, and caregiving responsibilities. The emotional toll and time commitment needed to coordinate healthcare, aged care, and home care services are significant and often overwhelming.

This initiative would profoundly assist caregivers like me by providing essential guidance in managing care and accessing critical services efficiently. Such support is crucial, not only for easing the burden on caregivers but also for ensuring that our elderly loved ones receive the care they deserve.

As Australia's population ages, the demand for structured, compassionate caregiving support will only increase.

Over the past few years, my role in his life has significantly shifted; I now handle the entirety of his administration, from medical appointments and bill payments to transportation and fielding unchecked phone calls—summing up to at least 15 hours each week. 

The most challenging part of my caregiving journey is the deep desire to spend quality time with my father during his last months, rather than being overwhelmed by the administrative duties that his care entails.

My name is Christina Tsobanis from Burwood, and I am writing to you not just on behalf of myself but all Australians caught in the heart-wrenching situation of caregiving. For over eight years, I have been the primary carer for my mother, Sophie Tsobanis, who lives with Alzheimer’s, and my aunty, Vasiliki Delkoussis, who suffers from stage 4 kidney failure among other health issues.

Caring for them means managing every aspect of their daily lives, balancing between who needs me more urgently at any given time. The complexity and severity of their conditions mean that our days are unpredictable and often filled with immediate and urgent needs. This role has significantly altered my life, stretching my mental and emotional bandwidth to its limits.

What has compounded the difficulty of this personal journey is the constant shifting landscape of support systems. Navigating the aged care system has been a relentless challenge; endless changes in rules and processes, and the erosion of previously available supports have left me scrambling many times to bridge gaps on my own.

I'm pleading for your support of a national initiative, akin to the proposed Violet's program, which could offer visible and stabilising support for caregivers like myself. Such a program would provide crucial resources, emotional support, and practical advice at a national level.

Please consider advocating for better care structures that not only offers transparency and consultations but also respects the personal sacrifice of countless Australians caring for their loved ones. Our collective well-being hinges on acknowledging and supporting this tireless, growing community.

I am writing to you as a proactive member of the ""Sandwich Generation,"" currently navigating the complex responsibilities of caring for my father, while also supporting my own children in their twenties. My father is 79 years old, and over recent years, his need for support has increased dramatically.

Each day presents a challenge as I strive to be super organised, ensuring both my father's needs and those of my children are met. The most significant strain, however, is not on my time or resources, but on my relationship with my husband, who often finds himself sidelined due to my caregiving commitments. 

The emotional toll of balancing these duties with personal relationships is immense. What would significantly alleviate this burden is access to specialised support services that include assistance in having important conversations about future caregiving plans. This issue often goes unaddressed until it becomes a pressing necessity, leaving families unprepared and overwhelmed.

Therefore, I respectfully urge you to lend your support to initiatives such as Violet's national program. Such programs are not just investments in individual families but are vital for societal stability as Australia's population ages. By providing practical guidance and emotional support, we can improve the quality of life for caregivers and those they care for, fostering a compassionate, supportive community across our nation.

I am writing to bring attention to the daily struggles of individuals like myself, who find themselves in demanding dual roles across different generations.

Caring for my mother while managing two jobs and being present for my daughter's critical school year has been profoundly challenging. The physical distance between my mother and me adds another layer of complexity, and the emotional toll is substantial. As her primary support, especially since we enacted an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPOA), the pressure to manage her wellbeing from afar is overwhelming.

Access to resources that bridge these gaps and mitigate the emotional, physical, and logistical challenges of caregiving is crucial.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for the support and expansion of Violet’s national program, which is pivotal in providing the necessary guidance and support for caregivers handling the complexities of elderly care. This initiative would immensely benefit individuals grappling with the balance of caregiving, work, and family life, ensuring they do not have to face these challenges alone.

The transition into becoming my mum’s caregiver while balancing the responsibilities of work and family life has been arduous and relentless. The need for support grows each day, yet Mum's reluctance to have external caregivers enter her home puts additional strain on my already limited time and energy.

Spending two hours every week supporting Mum might not sound much, but these hours are squeezed into a schedule that leaves no room for rest or self-care. The emotional and physical toll is palpable, not just on me but on my entire family. The reality is that our situation will only intensify as Mum grows older.

Support services that facilitate crucial conversations and assist us in navigating and managing this complicated care journey would be invaluable. It’s clear that this is not just my battle; it resonates across our community and the nation, particularly among those of us in the 'Sandwich Generation,' caught between raising children and caring for elderly parents.

Over recent years, my role in her life has shifted significantly towards managing both her healthcare and home life, a commitment consuming upwards of 20 hours each week.

Over the past few years, our roles have painfully reversed—once she cared for me, now I am her caregiver. The hardest part, amidst many challenges, is seeing her forget who I am, as her memory fades day by day.

We're responsible for everything from preparing meals and managing medications to ensuring that dad, who is prone to wandering, remains safe. The weight of these responsibilities is considerable.

Living more than two hours away from my own 12-year-old son to fulfill these duties leaves a profound emotional toll.

Managing these substantial responsibilities within the ongoing cost of living crisis is incredibly challenging.

The demands of caregiving involve extensive coordination of my mother's finances, household management, and healthcare, consuming over 20 hours of my week, every week. This intense commitment significantly affects my emotional well-being and personal life, as I also navigate the complexities of single parenthood and work.

The juggling act of caregiving involves physically flying out every six weeks, which not only imposes heavy financial burdens but also strains my emotional and physical wellbeing. The distance makes routine involvement in his care particularly demanding, and each visit requires extensive planning and financial expenditure to ensure everything back home is in order while I'm away.

For over 20 years, I have been engaged in caregiving, a role that transcends typical parenting due to the complex needs of my charges. This relentless dedication has magnified as I navigate both aged care for my parents and the NDIS for my young dependents. Both systems, while supportive in intent, are often convoluted and overwhelming to manage concurrently.

The support that would make a monumental difference in our lives includes streamlined access to and navigation of health, aged care, and home care services, ensuring that caregivers like myself aren’t perpetually caught in a web of bureaucracy and emotional fatigue.

I urge you to advocate for improved national support for caregivers who are essential to the fabric of our society. Support from Violet's national program would be invaluable, providing the necessary guidance and emotional support to manage these multifaceted caregiving roles efficiently.

My name is Kylie Garlando, and I reside in the suburban area of postcode 3024, currently navigating the heart-wrenching journey of caring for my 75-year-old father, Ron. After the passing of my mother in 2019, my father’s primary carer, I stepped into a role that has profoundly changed my life. Dad was diagnosed in 2022 with Alzheimer's and Vascular dementia, diseases which continue to aggressively strip him of his independence and recognition of loved ones.

Each day, alongside my brother, I help Dad manage his medications, daily routines, and the intense emotional fluctuations that often see him angered or upset over misconstrued memories. His adamant refusal to consider residential aged care facilities means we are his only support network.

The challenge lies not only in the daily care but in witnessing the decline of a once strong and decisive man. It is mentally exhausting and emotionally draining, especially when dementia invades his temperament, leading him to say hurtful things. While I understand it's the illness speaking, it doesn't lessen the pain.

Support in having effective, compassionate conversations with Dad, particularly about his condition and care preferences, would be invaluable to maintain his dignity and our mental health. Moreover, Carers like us, struggling in suburban regions, need more robust support networks that understand the unique challenges of caring for someone with dementia.

I implore you to advocate for increased support and funding for initiatives such as Violet’s national program, focusing on providing specialist dementia care training for family carers and ensuring adequate resources and services are reachable, particularly in suburban areas like ours. This support could be the difference between merely coping and managing effectively.

My name is Jenny Duggan, and I recently endured the deeply painful experience of being the primary caregiver for my elderly mother, Alba, during her final days. Alba, who battled cancer, dementia, and diabetes, needed palliative care at home—care that my siblings and I attempted to provide amidst our full-time jobs. Despite our dedication, the sheer workload was unsustainable and emotionally crushing. On numerous occasions, we felt that the healthcare system failed us, from inadequate community care packages to disrespectful treatment in palliative facilities.

The most agonising part for me, as a registered nurse, was witnessing the neglect and mismanagement of my mother's conditions by some care providers, compounded by their dismissal of our input as her next of kin. This experience led me to take six months off work, which has been financially devastating.

I am writing to urge you to advocate for robust support mechanisms for caregivers nationwide, highlighting the critical need for improvements in palliative care and professional respect and inclusion of family caregivers in medical discussions and decisions. Investing in comprehensive training for healthcare providers, ensuring they respect and collaborate with family caregivers, is crucial.

I ask that you support the strengthening of national caregiver support initiatives, such as those proposed by Violet's national program. Improved client-focused care, respect for the caregiving role, and recognition of next-of-kin input can significantly enhance the quality and humanity of palliative care, providing our loved ones with the dignity they deserve in their final moments.

My name is Michelle Thomas, and I write to you as both a full-time professional and a devoted daughter to my 84-year-old mother, who requires increasing care due to her age. Managing her daily needs—from clothing and food to medical appointments and social engagements—while I continue to work full-time, presents profound challenges that I am compelled to share with you.

The dual role I play in my mother's life and in professional circles is emotionally draining and logistically complex. I find myself constantly juggling her health requirements with job responsibilities, which leaves little time for personal rest or family interaction outside these obligations. My biggest strain comes from not fully understanding the support systems available, which would make planning for her later stages in life significantly easier and less stressful.

This challenge is not unique to me but is indicative of what many Australians face, particularly those of us in the 'Sandwich Generation' caring for elderly parents while supporting our own families. The emotional toll and practical difficulties are immense.

Therefore, I earnestly request your support for the funding of Violet’s national program, designed to offer guidance and assistance to caregivers like myself. Such support would enable us to manage our caregiving responsibilities more effectively, ensuring our loved ones receive the care they need without sacrificing our wellbeing or professional obligations.

This is not merely a personal request, but a call to action to enrich the support system for Australia's aging population and their caregivers nationwide.

I’m Rowena Forbes from Balga, WA, writing to share my journey as a caregiver to my 80-year-old mother, Judy. Currently, Judy remains relatively independent, but as her daughter and primary support, I see changes that signal she'll soon need more help. This slow but inevitable transition is filled with worries about my ability to support her through the last stages of her life while managing my own responsibilities.

The most challenging aspect of caregiving is respecting Judy's autonomy while ensuring her safety and well-being. As Judy ages, the decisions about her care become more complex and the emotional toll on me increases. Like many in my situation, I find the prospect of planning for end-of-life care daunting. Support in this area would not only help me but also ensure Judy lives her final years with the dignity she deserves.

Endorsing Violet's national program would be a significant step, offering practical help and emotional support that could ease the burden on families like mine.

The demographic shifts in our country point to a growing need for robust caregiver support systems. By investing in these supports, we can ensure that elderly Australians and their caregivers are looked after compassionately.

Balancing work and caregiving responsibilities without sufficient governmental support has increased our family’s financial strain and emotional toll. Every day involves getting the children ready for school, organising meals, maintaining the household, and managing my job commitments—with shifts that often extend into the late evenings, seven days a week. This hustle leaves me not only physically exhausted but also constantly wrestling with guilt and anxiety over whether I can provide enough for both the emotional and physical needs of my family. 

The lack of support systems for caregivers in financial distress and those managing complex family dynamics further exacerbates our challenges. A programme like Violet’s, offering targeted help and resources for families like mine, would be a game-changer. It would not just alleviate the immediate financial and emotional pressures but also improve our ability to effectively care for our loved ones while sustaining our livelihoods.

Over the past few years, my life has significantly balanced between working and managing the exhaustive daily needs of my mother, including meal preparation, medication management, and ensuring her social interaction.

This dual role has placed me firmly within what is often referred to as the 'Sandwich Generation', as I struggle to sustain my career, personal independence, and my mother's care. Despite being married, I find myself ineligible for financial aid, which compounds our difficulties and pushes me into dependence on my husband's income, a situation echoing the constraints of past eras where women had few financial rights.

The most harrowing aspect of my experience is the total loss of my social interactions and the emotional toll of being constantly needed. My situation is a stark illustration of the challenges faced in non-metropolitan areas like ours, where specialised services and support networks are sparse, exacerbating the strain on caregivers.

Given these challenges, I urge you to support and advocate for the expansion of national programs that assist caregivers like myself.

My name is Jannina Brady from Arakoon, postcode 2431. I write to you not just as a resident but as a daughter and sister in a challenging caregiving role. At 86, my mother requires careful attention due to declining mobility and wavering cognition. Simultaneously, my 67-year-old sister, who is intellectually impaired, needs 24/7 care as her own mobility deteriorates and she grapples with continence issues.

I am their primary caregiver while also managing a full-time job. The emotional and mental toll, compounded by physical exhaustion, is overwhelming. These duties have forced me to reorder my life, prioritising caregiving above my own personal and professional aspirations. The National Disability Insurance Scheme assists us marginally, but the gaps in care and support are still considerable, particularly in our rural setting where accessing specialised services becomes an ordeal.

The hardest part of this journey has been trying to maintain a balance between work, personal life, and the escalating care needs of my loved ones. This struggle is not mine alone; it is a national issue affecting countless Australians, particularly the 'Sandwich Generation' who find themselves caregivers to elderly parents while supporting themselves and, often, their children.

I appeal to your office to strongly advocate for and support Violet’s national program. This initiative promises not only to provide practical aids but also emotional support and guidance in navigating aged care services, a lifeline for caregivers like myself across Australia as our population ages.

I am reaching out to share my current circumstances as I navigate the complexities and personal challenges of caring for my 87-year-old father, Greg. After years of independence, my father now requires substantial help, needing assistance for mobility and transport to various appointments, which I provide. My commitment to his well-being impacts my work significantly, as I often have to reduce my working hours or miss shifts entirely.

Being a primary caregiver while managing employment responsibilities is not only physically demanding but emotionally taxing as well. Watching both of my parents become increasingly reliant on me has been a profound emotional journey, compounded by the pressure of juggling these responsibilities with no formal support or financial assistance from services like Centrelink.

The greatest hurdle I face is managing my time to ensure I can fulfil my duties as a daughter, employee, and individual. The emotional toll and practical challenges of coordinating care, coupled with financial concerns, create an overwhelming experience that affects my well-being and job security.

Given these circumstances, I urge you to advocate for increased support for caregivers nationwide through initiatives like Violet’s national program. This program promises to deliver essential guidance, offer emotional support, and facilitate easier navigation through aged care services, which would be invaluable for individuals like myself who are striving to provide care amidst personal and professional pressures.

My name is Jody North, and I am writing to you from the rural region of 2450, where I live as the primary carer for my 74-year-old mother with Alziehmers. In recent years, I've left a fulfilling job to provide her with 24/7 care— a decision that profoundly impacts my social life, financial security, and mental well-being. It has been my choice to do this as I feel home is best for my mum and I love this for her. I have not needed to take mum to hospital for any concerns in the past year, she has not had INFLUENZA nor COVID. Her mind is why I stay with her in her home because her garden brings her love and calm as we both do for each other.


Full-time caregiving is a relentless task that keeps me on high alert both physically and mentally. It's not only about the loss of income and superannuation but also about managing severe family strains, as I navigate this journey with little support from my sister, who lives 13 hours away. The hardest aspect has been the dramatic shift in my everyday life, from engaging actively in work and social events to facing extended periods of isolation and responsibility.

In areas like ours, where resources are less accessible, the challenges magnify. Support services for family dynamics and stress management would be tremendously beneficial, not only for me but for many in similar situations around our region and beyond.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced national support programs for caregivers. By backing initiatives like Violet’s national program, you can help address the dire needs for practical guidance, mental health support, and community-based services which are crucial for rural caregivers.

Most notably, living in a regional area poses additional burdens, from fewer healthcare options to more complicated logistics in accessing appropriate support services. The balance of care, work, and life is precarious—often tipping towards overwhelming. I serve as an unpaid caregiver, which significantly impacts my emotional wellbeing and limits my availability for professional and personal commitments.

I support my parents, Julie and David Wakeford, extensively for 25 hours a week aiding them with medical documentation, housing applications, and navigating age care services. Despite our tenacity, my parents often do not acknowledge their diminishing capacities, inadvertently derailing our efforts and complicating financial aid. My responsibilities extend into my son Sam’s life, assisting him through challenges with gender dysphoria and serious mental health struggles. Adding to this complex caregiving situation, I recently endeavoured to enter the workforce post-business closure, only to realise the stark employability challenges facing women in my age bracket.

The most disheartening part, however, has been the failure of governmental systems to fully recognise and support my multifaceted role as a caregiver.

Over recent years, my role has dramatically transitioned to nearly constant caregiving, which consumes about 28 hours a week.

By advocating for better caregiver support on a national level, we can offer relief and resources to many Australians in similar circumstances. Our population is ageing, and without adequate support structures, too many will face these challenges unsupported.

I am Diana Paterson from Innaloo, reaching out amidst a phase of life that is growing ever more challenging. As a daughter supporting an aging mother who increasingly requires assistance, I am deeply involved in managing her appointments, administration, and day-to-day needs. Simultaneously, balancing my own mental health has become a critical aspect of my daily life, especially as I navigate the complexities born from a diagnosed mood disorder.

The hardest aspect of my caregiving role is finding sufficient time to meet all these demands, which strains both my mental wellbeing and my ability to maintain other responsibilities. What intensifies these challenges is my need to become well-versed in navigating our health, aged care, and home care services, a complex landscape that is often daunting to traverse without guidance.

Australians like myself, earnestly caring for our elderly loved ones while managing personal health issues, are in urgent need of structured support. Programs that provide clear, navigable pathways through the aged care system, alongside emotional and administrative support, would greatly alleviate the pressures faced by care providers.

I urge you to advocate further support for caregivers nationally, focusing on the development and funding of comprehensive programs such as Violet's national initiative. These programs are vital not only for supporting our aging population but also in ensuring their caregivers sustain their own health and well-being.

This form of national support would represent a significant step towards recognising and resolving the unique challenges faced by individuals like myself, particularly in understanding and accessing the necessary services for elderly care.

Thank you for considering this essential enhancement to caregiver support.

I am writing to you as a constituent from the 6007 postcode area, passionately sharing my lived experience in the hope of illuminating the profound challenges faced by many Australians in similar situations. I am the primary caregiver for my mother, Yvonne, who is 87 years old. Over the past few years, Yvonne has become increasingly dependent due to her deteriorating memory, which has significantly altered her personality and capabilities.

The emotional toll of witnessing the gradual loss of the vibrant person she once was is indescribable. My days are now consumed with managing her needs, and one of the most distressing aspects has been handling the complex family dynamics that arise due to stress and differing views on care approaches.

Residing in a region where specialised support services for caregivers like myself are sparse only compounds these difficulties. The challenge is not only in the physical caregiving tasks but also in the emotional resilience required to navigate this turbulent journey.

The support that could truly make a difference would be a national framework that recognises and aids the 'Sandwich Generation' —those of us caught between caring for ageing parents and managing our own lives and commitments. Programs that provide guidance on managing family dynamics effectively, as well as direct support for caregivers, would be invaluable.

I urge you to advocate for greater support and to consider endorsing initiatives such as Violet’s national program, which promises practical and emotional assistance tailored to the unique needs of caregivers across our country. It is imperative that as our population ages, robust systems are in place to support those who care for the elderly, mitigating the immense strains placed upon them.

My name is Carolyn Xaftellis, and I write to you as a constituent deeply embedded in the responsibility of caring for my 83-year-old mother, Julie. Despite her strong spirit, a severe spine fracture 18 months ago rendered her dependent on my full-time care for three months. Since then, balancing her needs with my other obligations has significantly reshaped my life.

Living in postal area 6018, Mum’s incident stressed not just the emotional and physical demands on me but highlighted the profound gaps in our knowledge and accessibility of resources for elderly care. Navigating the health system, understanding aged care options, and arranging home care services often feels like navigating a labyrinth without a map.

The truth is, the challenges faced in ensuring Mum lives with dignity and support are not mine alone. Across our nation, countless individuals find themselves in this ‘Sandwich Generation’, juggling care for elderly parents while managing their own lives and often, their children’s lives too. The emotional toll is immense, and the impact on our work and personal life balance is often unsustainable without external support.

I implore you to advocate for the national rollout of Violet’s program. Such support would not only provide crucial guidance and emotional support but also assist caregivers like myself in effectively navigating aged care services. This program is an essential investment in the health and wellbeing of Australia’s aging population and those who care for them.

It is our collective responsibility to ensure that no one feels overwhelmed or alone in such a fundamental aspect of life as caring for our elders.

My name is Charlotte S, and I write to you not just on my behalf but representing many Australians in similar situations. I live in the suburb 6009 while caring for my 81-year-old father, Karel. My father struggles with the English language and is gradually losing his independence, which has elevated my role from just being a daughter to being his primary caregiver.

The journey of managing dad's medical appointments, household tasks, and transitioning him to the technological world consumes considerable time and mental energy. Consequently, this responsibility reduces the quality time I could have spent with my own family and managing my career. Particularly tough is seeing him decline steadily, combined with my inability to provide sufficient support to my mother who lives with dementia.

Living in a somewhat affluent area compounds these challenges, making access to needed services and support even harder. The lack of suitable, affordable, local and accessible resources for elderly care in our community further strains our situation. For example I've waited six months for travel support and recently been advised it isn't available. For context we are within 10km of our CBD, dad can barely walk 10m without some form of assistance and using public transport has just become inaccessible for this reason.

The support that would change our lives involves having better access to navigating the health, aged care, and home care service systems. This assistance is not just a personal necessity but a growing national need as many Australians face the aging of loved ones.

I urge you to consider advocating for Violet's national program, which could greatly benefit caregivers by providing essential guidance, emotional support, and navigational help in aged care services. Such support would mean the world to constituents like myself, ensuring we do not have to care alone.

The role of caregiving, although filled with moments of joy and deep connection, brings significant challenges that impact my daily life profoundly. Balancing a 30-35 hour work week and caregiving duties has been overwhelming. It strains not only my time but also affects precious moments that I could spend with my husband and friends. Emotionally, the hardest part is watching my mother's health decline and feeling handcuffed by the lack of adequate support, particularly from adequately trained professionals who understand the unique needs of aging individuals in rural settings.

Enhanced access to information on health, aged care, and home care services would significantly alleviate the burden we carry every day.

I am currently sharing the care responsibilities for my mother, Judy, who is 86 and lives with dementia. Judy's capabilities are declining, and the care she requires increases as her condition worsens.

Living 45 minutes away with two young children and a full-time job, I am only able to assist in person on weekends, while my brother, who lives much closer, bears most daily responsibilities. Despite our efforts, the difficulty of navigating the health and aged care systems, coupled with our personal commitments, places a tremendous emotional and logistical strain on us both.

The hardest part of this journey is seeing our mother's continuous decline and knowing that despite our best efforts, we're competing against her progressing illness without adequate support. It often feels like a losing battle, leading to significant stress and frustration. To better support families like ours, clear guidance and sufficient resources to navigate health, aged care, and home care services are crucial.

I urge you to advocate for the funding and development of Violet's national program, designed to assist Australian families in managing and planning the care of their ageing loved ones. This program is essential, not only for providing practical tools but also for offering emotional support that can significantly lessen the burden on caregivers.

My name is Sarah Bramham, a registered nurse from Croydon, Victoria. I'm currently the sole support for the elderly parents of my late friend. Marjorie, frail and dependent, and her husband Ken, who is still her carer despite suffering a recent stroke. They are adamant about remaining in their lifelong home, which compounds the complexity of the situation.

Despite my medical background, the challenge I often face is their reluctance to plan for imminent care needs. This resistance, coupled with my professional commitments and a recent bout of influenza, has limited my ability to be fully present. It feels as though I'm watching a looming crisis with my hands tied.

The greatest struggle in this role is not just the emotional toll and physical fatigue, but the overwhelming sense of helplessness.

This scenario reflects a broader national issue, particularly as our population ages and more Australians find themselves in similar caregiving roles.

My name is Dragica Arambasic, and I live in Croydon, Victoria. For the past few years, my role as Fred’s wife has fundamentally shifted. At 83, and unbeknownst to him due to his Alzheimer’s, Fred has grown increasingly dependent on me. While I continue to work full-time as a teacher, upon returning home, I am his sole carer. This dual responsibility is immensely challenging, especially as I struggle to understand the avenues for support, given Fred hasn't been formally assessed for services.

The transformation of losing a partner to the disease while simultaneously caring for them is indescribably painful. Fred’s gradual decline is something I witness daily, and not having clear guidelines on managing his condition exacerbates our distress. My available support is negligible, and the emotional and physical toll is substantial.

The assistance needs to be straightforward and readily available, helping those unversed in the complexities of healthcare and aged care systems.

My name is Rosie Campbell and I reside in Croydon North. I am writing to you today as a daughter, a mother, and a recently unemployed health professional who now devotes much of my time to caring for my 83-year-old mum, Frances. In the past year, her health has significantly declined, demanding more of my presence and transforming me into her primary carer, transport, and advocate.

Navigating the complexities of the aged care system has been an exhausting challenge that has impacted nearly every aspect of my life. What’s particularly distressing is the current necessity to argue for essential care levels and services that she urgently needs but cannot access in a timely manner. The emotional toll, coupled with a considerable commute to her residence, has strained my marriage and my ability to parent my two teenage sons effectively.

The difficulty in securing appropriate aged care services, alongside the financial stress of potentially paying for private care to expedite necessary support, has left me both physically and emotionally depleted. The advice frequently given – to hospitalise her to 'escalate the process' – seems inhumane and is not something I am willing to consider lightly.

Thus, I am calling on you to advocate for a national program like Violet's, which offers substantial support to family caregivers managing health, aged care, and home care services. Such a program would not only help in planning and navigating the complexities of aging care but also in preserving the dignity and quality of life for our elderly loved ones.

Support for this initiative will also serve to acknowledge and assist the 'Sandwich Generation', who find themselves juggling the care of both their children and aging parents.

My name is Simone, and I reside in the postcode 3133, where I have taken on the full-time role of caregiver for my elderly parents, aged 83 and 81. Recently, their health deteriorated rapidly, forcing me to transform from an occasional visitor to their primary carer virtually overnight. This shift led me to leave my employment, diving into caregiving which has now extended far beyond regular working hours.

The transition has been incredibly challenging. I’ve encountered numerous obstacles, from navigating red tape—even with Power of Attorney—to managing the emotional and financial strain as an unpaid carer. Balancing this with raising teenagers and running a family business has only compounded the stress and complexity of my situation. 

The support that would markedly change my life includes clearer pathways through health, aged care, and home care services. Currently, the process is bewildering and support seems scant, particularly when urgent care transitions are needed, as was the case when my husband had to physically carry my mother to our car to access respite services she urgently required.

I am reaching out to request your advocacy for enhanced national support systems for caregivers. Programs like Violet’s, which offer guidance and emotional support across care services, are vital. They not only aid carers like myself but also ensure that our elderly relatives receive the compassionate care they deserve in their twilight years.

Despite Dad's high needs, it took over three years to secure an aged care package. The difficulty in obtaining proper care and support from government services has not only burdened us with considerable time and effort but has also greatly impacted my mental health.

My name is Kaz Toss, and I am writing to you from a deeply personal place. At 80 years old, my mother Wendy has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Each day, I face the challenge of helping her maintain some semblance of normalcy in the comfort of her home. From driving her to appointments to reminding her of her daily medications, the weight of caregiving is heavy—amplified by my own health struggles.

Navigating the maze of health services, aged care, and home care options is daunting and often leaves me feeling overwhelmed. This task grows more herculean with the denial and confusion that Alzheimer’s brings into our lives. The dual pressures of caregiving and managing my health make it exceedingly difficult to provide the level of care my mother needs without compromising my well-being.

The increasing disposition of Australians caring for elderly parents, often while grappling with their own health issues, outlines a need for a national support system that can aid caregivers like myself. A system that not only provides practical guidance but also offers crucial support in handling the complexities of aged care, health, and personal well-being concurrently.

Therefore, I urge you to support the allocation of government funding towards Violet’s national program. This initiative would be instrumental in offering access to vital resources, ensuring caregivers are not left to flounder in the onerous journey of eldercare. Such support would mean not only improved quality of life for our ageing population but also invaluable aid to their caregivers, who take on this challenging role largely unnoticed.

Thank you for considering this pressing issue that affects countless Australian families.

My name is Belinda Stanley, and I'm currently the primary carer for my 86-year-old mother, Elaine, who resides in a small suburb with a postcode of 3200. As Elaine's sole advocate, I manage her aged care processes, having recently navigated the complex transition from her family home into a permanent aged care facility.

Despite my ability to handle the bureaucratic and technical aspects of aged care—which many find overwhelming—the emotional strain on both myself and my mother has been considerable. My mum’s displacement from the house she cherished for over 60 years to a clinical setting, stripping her of her autonomy and familiarity, has been heartbreakingly painful to witness.

Many Australians are in similar positions, lacking the capacity to comprehend intricate aged care options or the support structures required to effect such significant life changes. Additionally, the challenge is exacerbated for those who face language barriers or are hesitant to seek help.

I write to request your active backing for Violet’s national program that addresses these pressing needs. This program aims to offer essential guidance, emotional support, and navigational assistance in aged care services, which is vital for improving the quality of life for our ageing population and their struggling caregivers.

As our society continues to age, the importance of such support cannot be overstated. Having lived the challenges, I can affirm the difference structured and compassionate guidance can make. Therefore, I urge you to advocate for better caregiver resources at a national level to help families manage these daunting responsibilities.

My husband, aged 45, is living with multiple sclerosis, and we have two sons, aged 17 and 15, diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and type 1 diabetes, respectively. The progressive nature of my husband’s MS and the constant care required for our sons mean that our family faces a unique and challenging care environment every day.

In recent years, the needs of my loved ones have intensified to the point where I had to cease working to provide the necessary support around the clock. This shift to full-time caregiving has taken a toll on my own health and wellbeing, as I struggle to manage the emotional and physical demands placed upon me. The hardest part is knowing the challenges we face now are only set to increase, with very limited support systems in place to help.

What would greatly benefit carers like myself is streamlined access to health, aged care, and home care services, easing the burden of navigation that often adds to our stresses. Enhanced support would allow me to better care for my family and safeguard my own health.

I urge you to advocate for the expansion of practical, emotional, and administrative support services for carers across Australia.

My name is Nicole Howard from Langwarrin, postcode 3910, and I am writing to share my dual role as a full-time caregiver for my elderly mother, Nancy, and as a mother to my twin adolescents, Ash and Opal. Recently, my caring responsibilities deepened significantly as I spent two weeks full-time in the hospital with one of my children, relying solely on family and friends to support my mother and other child.

The inability to work during this period intensified the financial strain on our family, reflecting a critical challenge faced by many Australians within the 'Sandwich Generation.' We are caught in the relentless juggle of supporting our aging parents while nurturing our children. This has placed an unsustainable emotional and physical toll on my wellbeing, continually compromising my ability to meet professional commitments.

The pronounced challenges of rural caregiving further compound these difficulties, as specialised support services are not as accessible in Langwarrin as they might be in more urban settings. The lack of localised support services amplifies the pressure on caregivers like me, who must balance widespread needs with scarce resources.

Given our nation's aging population, I urge you to champion policies that bolster support for caregivers nationwide. Specifically, advocating for initiatives like Violet’s national program would offer crucial guidance, practical aid, and emotional support to families tackling similar challenges.

Supporting this program not only aids individual families but strengthens our communities and our nation’s health infrastructure at a foundational level.

Amidst working two jobs, I manage their appointments, medications, and continue to ensure the care standards for my mother, all of which leaves me without any personal leave due to their constant medical needs.

In recent years, Gail's health has deteriorated to the extent that I have had to resign from my role as a teacher to care for her, impacting our financial stability and putting significant strain on my physical and mental well-being.

Transitioning to living on a Carer’s payment after earning a full-time wage as a teacher has been one of our biggest challenges. The isolation of our circumstances is compounded by the difficulty of navigating health, aged care, and home care services, which are not only complex but also limited in our regional location.

Hence, I’m reaching out to ask for your support in advocating for improved national support programs for caregivers. Initiatives like Violet’s national program would provide much-needed guidance, helping carers like me navigate services and relieve some of our burdens.

My name is Therese McPeake, and I'm reaching out from Wyndham, a regional community where I care for my dear friend, Celia, who is 86 years old. Celia’s health has declined significantly, and she was recently admitted to hospital. As her health worsens, the fear that she might not be safe alone at home continually grows. 

Even though I provide social support and run errands for Celia, the emotional toll and the time commitment that this role requires are substantial. Watching her become more unwell and lose her independence has been heart-wrenching. It's clear that as her condition deteriorates, her needs are becoming more complex, and I am finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the level of care she requires without additional support.

What Celia and I desperately need is support with planning for the last stages of life and assistance in having important conversations about her care needs. This support would not only alleviate some of the emotional burden but would also guide us in making informed decisions about her future.

I urge you to advocate for and support the funding of national programs like Violet, which would provide essential resources for caregivers like myself. We are in dire need of practical guidance, emotional support, and assistance navigating aged care services, especially in rural and regional areas where resources are often scarce.

Since the passing of my mother, the full responsibility of managing my father's health, medications, and social life has fallen to me. This role comes at a time when I am also supporting my adult children and dealing with my own life’s challenges.

Being everything for my dad in his times of depression and isolation, while balancing my responsibilities to my own children, has placed a significant strain on me both emotionally and physically. This dual-role of caregiving has thrust me into the heart of what is often called the 'Sandwich Generation'—caring for both ageing parents and supporting one's own children.

The emotional toll and the time commitment required have affected every part of my life, and I am constantly anxious about the sustainability of this situation.

Therefore, I am urging you to advocate for and support the implementation of Violet’s national program. This initiative promises not only to provide practical help in navigating health and aged care services but also much-needed emotional support for caregivers like myself.

Over the past years, I've taken on the full-time role of caring for my 89-year-old father, John, as there were no places available in nearby nursing homes. This arrangement, although done out of love, has significantly altered our family dynamics and placed considerable strain on both my personal and professional life.

Caring for dad involves daily management of his appointments, assisting with daily activities, and continuous emotional support, especially as he experiences episodes of aggression due to his declining health. The hardest part has undoubtedly been the emotional toll on my family and the sheer exhaustion from juggling these immense responsibilities with my other commitments.

Caring for my father often feels like a juggling act. The physical demands are considerable, but it is the emotional strain and frustration from the gaping holes in our care system that weigh heaviest on me. Trying to navigate these complexities without sufficient professional aid makes each day unpredictable and, frankly, overwhelming.

One of our most pressing needs is for guided support in having critical conversations about my father’s future care needs. Effective communication in these discussions is crucial, yet incredibly challenging to manage on my own. Adopting Violet’s national program could immensely benefit caregivers like myself by providing practical guidance and emotional support, essential for those of us in rural, regional, or remote locations. The program's outreach could help bridge the significant service gaps we experience daily.

I urge you to advocate for policies that support the implementation of enhanced caregiver programs, recognising the unique trials faced by rural caregivers.

Providing Ruth with the necessary appointments, healthcare, and companionship for about 12 hours a day is both a duty and a privilege. However, as Ruth’s memory declines, her increasing need for care to mitigate loneliness and maintain positivity becomes more demanding. This role, requiring immense emotional and physical energy, often leaves me depleted. This is amidst managing delicate family dynamics as we all struggle to agree on the best approach for her care.

What makes our situation markedly challenging is our location. Living in Runaway Bay adds another layer of difficulty due to limited local resources and professional support necessary for caregiving. This has significantly intensified our day-to-day hardships.

Therefore, I implore you to advocate for an increase in support and resources, specifically for those in the 'Sandwich Generation’ who are tirelessly balancing the care of their elderly parents while fulfilling other family and work responsibilities. The implementation of a national program, such as Violet’s, that provides practical help and guidance in both remote and urban settings would be a lifeline for countless Australian families like mine.

With Australia’s ageing population, it’s critical we build a robust support system that helps caregivers sustain their own health and employment, while providing compassionate care for our elders.

Alongside these duties, I am navigating the complexities of my adult daughters’ health issues, all by myself.

This transition from friend to carer occurred rapidly and has dramatically reshaped my daily life, filled now with 24/7 responsibilities that leave little room for personal time or rest.

Living in the suburb of Helensvale, postcode 4214, our circumstances are intensified by the limitations of local support services accessible in less urban areas.

Since her diagnosis, my life has altered dramatically––I've had to leave my job and forego my superannuation, causing significant financial and emotional strain on our family.

Living with my husband and mother in our mortgaged home, we've navigated the complexities of a diminished income due to my full-time caregiving responsibilities. Despite receiving Carer's Payment and Carer's Allowance, the means testing associated with these benefits inadequately reflects our financial reality. In fact, when my husband earns extra through overtime, our assistance is further reduced, complicating our situation as we struggle to meet daily expenses while ensuring adequate care for my mother.

The emotional toll is immense. Each day involves managing my mother's medication, meals, and personal care, alongside coping with her unpredictable responses due to her condition. This constant demand has isolated us socially and placed our lives on an indefinite hold––a situation made even harder by our recent move to be closer to family, who have unfortunately not been able to provide the support we anticipated.

It is critical that the government recognises the challenges faced by the 'Sandwich Generation,' like myself, who care for aging parents while managing their own financial and personal needs. I urge you to advocate for policy reforms that increase financial support for caregivers, taking into account the full scope of their sacrifices and contributions.

Living in a rural location compounds these challenges significantly. Access to healthcare and aged care resources is limited, and the sparse availability of services further strains our situation. Support in navigating the complex landscape of health, aged care, and home care services would greatly alleviate the burden we face.

I am reaching out to ask for your active support for Violet's national program, which is aimed at providing essential guidance, emotional support, and practical assistance in navigating aged care services. This initiative would not only benefit my family but also countless others in our community and across Australia, particularly those in rural areas who often face similar challenges.

Your endorsement of this program would represent a significant step towards improving the quality of life for Australia’s ageing population and their caregivers. I urge you to consider how such support could positively transform many lives.

My name is Catherine Beavis, and I reside in the rural suburb of Glasshouse Mountains. I am reaching out to share my experience and to advocate for better support systems for individuals like myself, who are part of the 'Sandwich Generation'—caring for elderly parents while balancing work and family life.

As a registered nurse, I am the primary caregiver and social support for my parents, Moya, 80, and John, 85. Although they currently live independently, their health and dependence on care are rapidly increasing. My father, particularly dependent on my mother, has made it such that I am urgently needed for medical appointments and emergencies, the latter of which recently interrupted my first holiday in years. 

This constant readiness to assist, coupled with my professional duties and family obligations, has stretched me thin. Navigating health and aged care systems while also attempting to mediate important conversations about future care plans adds to an already overwhelming situation.

The major challenge for us, especially living in a rural area, is the lack of readily accessible support services that can help manage these complexities. Therefore, I urge you to support initiatives like Violet’s national program, which aims to provide resources and guidance to caregivers. Such support would significantly alleviate the burden on families like mine, ensuring that our elderly loved ones receive the care they need without compromising our health and well-being.

I ask that you advocate for enhanced support for caregivers across Australia, recognising the unique challenges faced by those in rural regions. This is not only crucial for our aging population but for their families who care deeply for them.

Thank you for considering this vital issue.

My name is Kerrie Peck, and I am currently facing the immense challenge of caring for my elderly mother who is battling dementia, as well as my daughter, who has ADHD. We reside in the 4553 postcode area, balancing the demands of caregiving with my own personal and professional responsibilities.

Caring for my mother requires constant attention and support, especially as her dementia progresses. Simultaneously, my daughter's needs related to her ADHD necessitate a different type of care, one that is equally demanding. Juggling these responsibilities while maintaining my employment and studies is proving to be extremely difficult. The hardest part? Ensuring we keep a stable home environment with a roof over our heads and food on the table.

Being part of the 'Sandwich Generation', my situation highlights the often-overlooked plight of individuals who are caught between raising a child and caring for aging parents. Moreover, the complexities of caring in a rural area add an additional layer of difficulty, with limited access to specialised resources and support systems.

The introduction of a comprehensive national program, such as Violet’s initiative, would provide essential support not only to our family but to many Australians in similar situations. This program could offer guidance on managing the specific challenges faced by caregivers, resources for interacting with health services, and support for essential conversations about care and well-being.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced national support for caregivers. By backing initiatives like Violet's program, you can significantly alleviate the burden on families like mine, ensuring better quality of life for both the elderly and their caregivers across Australia.

I am reaching out to share my personal struggle and to seek your support on a matter that affects many Australians. Currently, I am challenged with my deteriorating health, undergoing dialysis treatment seven days a week, which is not only physically draining but also emotionally taxing.

Caring for myself in these harsh conditions robs me of experiencing life fully, leaving me disheartened and frustrated. The difficulty of managing my condition, coupled with the stress of contemplating end-of-life planning, weighs heavily upon me daily.

Support systems focusing on planning for the last stages of life, along with accessible healthcare advice specific to those of us managing severe chronic conditions, are urgently needed. Moreover, the implementation of comprehensive support services, such as those proposed by Violet's national program, could be a lifeline for individuals like myself.

This program offers crucial guidance and emotional support which would markedly improve our ability to handle the complexities of health deterioration with dignity and ease. Implementing such a program would not only benefit individuals but foster a more compassionate community sensitive to the dilemmas faced at end-of-life stages.

My mother, having lived independently for many years, now resides with my family due to decreased mobility and increased vulnerability post-COVID. Balancing her care with the needs of my four children, ranging from 13 to 21 years old, has significantly stretched our family’s resources and emotional bandwidth.

The daily responsibilities of ensuring my mother’s safety and well-being, alongside managing her numerous medical appointments – which I often struggle to attend – is a growing challenge. The constant pressure to prevent accidents and the loneliness she feels when we must keep our distance for health reasons, adds a considerable strain. Unfortunately, accessing support services has been daunting, with complicated processes that are difficult to navigate amidst our already hectic lives.

This intense juggling act is characteristic of the 'Sandwich Generation,' who find themselves caring for both their children and elderly parents. Like many others in this situation, particularly in less urban areas like ours where services can be sparse, I am in desperate need of streamlined access to healthcare and aged care support systems.

Please consider advocating for the national implementation of Violet’s program. Such a program would offer crucial navigation assistance for health, aged care, and home care services that could greatly alleviate the mental and emotional load on families like mine.

Alongside my sister, I dedicate 10-15 hours each week to ensure Mum's needs are met - cooking, cleaning, and managing her medical appointments.

The challenge, however, extends beyond the direct care I provide. Balancing this responsibility with managing my own family and maintaining full-time employment is increasingly strenuous. The emotional toll and physical exhaustion that comes with juggling these significant parts of my life are daunting. I am constantly trying to fulfil my duties as a mother, employee, and carer, all of which are roles that demand attention and energy.

One of the critical supports that would significantly ease this burden is better access to and navigation of health, aged care, and home care services for Australians like myself. The complexity of managing care within our current system can be overwhelming and often feels like a labyrinth that's hard to navigate.

I implore you to advocate for and support the funding of Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to offer crucial guidance, emotional support, and assistance in navigating aged services, which would be invaluable to family carers across the nation.

I am a carer for several dependents: my 83-year-old parent, my partner aged 50, and my three children, all of whom have disabilities and are aged 32, 19, and 17. My responsibilities have intensified over the years, requiring me to offer round-the-clock care—personal, medical, and emotional support.

This role has compelled me to semi-retire from my professional career and deplete my financial reserves, including my superannuation, to manage continuous medical expenses and daily care needs. The financial strain, coupled with the emotional and physical demands of caregiving, is overwhelming without any form of respite.

The challenges I face are exacerbated due to our location and the complex needs of not just an elderly parent but a partner and children with disabilities. Effective support systems for caregivers like myself are critically needed. Access to resources that aid in managing care responsibilities, financial assistance, and emotional support would significantly alleviate the pressures faced by caregivers nationwide.

I am currently caring for my 18-year-old child under circumstances that require constant adaptation and balancing of emotional and practical needs. 

The most pressing challenges I encounter include maintaining boundaries and managing the essentials, such as ensuring we have the right groceries which suit specific health needs. These might seem like minor issues but are reflective of the larger, constant juggle between differing needs and opinions within the family, especially under stress.

The emotional labour involved in managing these family dynamics is immense and often leaves little room for addressing my own needs or those of other family members. Support systems that could assist in managing these dynamics, alongside providing general caregiving guidance, would be invaluable not just to me, but to many in similar situations.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support enhanced national programs, like those proposed by Violet, aimed at assisting families to navigate these challenges with greater support and fewer personal sacrifices. Improved support services would empower caregivers like myself to maintain not only the care of our loved ones but also the wellbeing of our entire families.

Amidst the struggles of managing work and family life, caring for my mum has brought a profound emotional toll similar to experiencing ‘living bereavement’.

Each day, after working 7-8 hours, I visit my mum to ensure she is okay, often returning home exhausted around 7pm. Despite attempting to access services through Aged Care, the lack of effective communication and the daunting process exacerbate our hardships.

At present, I am navigating the complexities of caring for my mother, Carol, who was recently diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. I live in Lindisfarne, Hobart, while she resides in Adelaide, adding interstate challenges to our caregiving dynamic.

The recent diagnosis has upended our family structure as my mother simultaneously coped with caring for my grandmother. The situation forced my granny into residential aged care as Mum's ability to care for her deteriorated alongside her health. I manage this whilst juggling co-parenting my five-year-old son, maintaining full-time employment, and upholding a newly adjusted life in Hobart. The emotional toll and logistical nightmares of living in different states are continual sources of anxiety and strain for me.

I am Nina Peheim, a resident of the 3012 area, juggling the full-time care of my two teenage sons while working a full-time job. My caregiving responsibilities magnified significantly after the passing of their father two years ago, leaving me without financial or familial support.

One of my sons is disengaged, requiring constant mentoring and supervision, which includes managing his internet usage to ensure his safety—this has not been easy. Additionally, ensuring both of my boys attend school necessitates daily drives as they lack the initiative to manage this independently. Between cooking, mentoring, and commuting, the emotional and financial toll is immense.

The hardest part of my caregiving role is the sheer emotional weight and the financial pressure it brings. Caregiving, in my experience, is a round-the-clock responsibility that leaves little room for personal or professional growth and has put considerable strain on our well-being and stability.

Support that could alleviate these burdens would be transformational. Specifically, funding for programs that provide emotional support, financial advice, and practical caregiving guidance would offer relief to many in my situation.

My name is Georgie Kearnan, and I am writing to share the heartfelt story of caring for my mother, Nancy, who recently passed away at the age of 98. Despite living in another state, I dedicated over 7 hours weekly to manage her care, arranging everything from home care to essential appointments, while maintaining a full-time job and personal life.

Nancy lived in a regional area, 3873 postcode, and as her needs grew with age, the challenge of ensuring she could remain at home escalated. I managed her home care package myself, which, while giving me control to handpick suitable carers through platforms like Mabel, also added to the emotional and financial strain I experienced. Unfortunately, I was not entitled to any carer support due to not living nearby, burdening me further.

The hardest part of this role was ensuring her ability to stay in her home during her final years, juggling frequent travels to oversee her care and resolving numerous issues that arose, particularly with staffing. These challenges highlight the critical need for better support systems for long-distance caregivers like myself who manage care from afar and face unique challenges in rural settings.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for enhanced national support for caregivers, particularly for the 'Sandwich Generation' who balance supporting ageing parents while managing their own lives. Implementing a program like Violet’s nationally can provide crucial guidance, aid in navigating health and aged care services, and support family dynamics under stress.

This support will not only aid caregivers but will resonate across our community, enhancing the quality of life for our elderly citizens and those who care for them.

Warm regards,

My name is Jackie, and I am writing to you from a place of deep concern and exhaustion. My sister and I are the primary caregivers for our 90-year-old mother, Julie, who is courageously battling dementia and terminal cancer at home in Melbourne. Over the past few years, our role has evolved from helping her with daily chores to providing round-the-clock care.

The transition has been overwhelming. Despite having a Level 4 home care package, the support provided is grossly insufficient for her complex needs. The health system seems fragmented, leaving us to juggle between a palliative team that cannot support dementia care and a dementia team that is ill-equipped for cancer support. It feels as though the system sees her diseases first and her humanity second; it fails to deliver holistic care. This has not only left Julie vulnerable but has also pushed us to our physical and emotional limits.

The hardest part is knowing that our mother, who spent her life serving the community and even received an OAM for her dedication, is not receiving the support she deserves in her most vulnerable days. It is heartbreaking to see her end-of-life care handled without the dignity it should command.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for comprehensive support systems that address the needs of the ‘Sandwich Generation’ like us, providing effective guidance and practical assistance in navigating the complex health and aged care landscape. Your support for a national program like Violet’s, which helps families manage elderly care, could truly make a difference.

My name is Amanda Trotter, and I reside in Brighton, postcode 3186. The past few years have seen me undertaking an increasingly demanding role as the primary caregiver for my mother, Marie, who is 79. This commitment involves over 15 hours per week, providing emotional and practical support, which has proven to be not only time-consuming but deeply traumatising.

The interaction I once shared with my mother is steadily diminishing. Caring for her in her declining years has made me feel as though I am losing her piece by piece, which is incredibly painful. This role, albeit filled with love, carries the profound emotional toll of watching a beloved parent fade away while managing personal and professional responsibilities.

One of the grave challenges we face is effectively communicating about sensitive, yet crucial topics such as end-of-life care and her daily needs. Resources that facilitate these important conversations would be immensely beneficial, helping to alleviate some of the emotional burdens we currently endure.

Given the growing need to support our ageing population and their caregivers, I urge you to advocate for increased funding and support for initiatives like Violet’s national program. Programs like these offer vital guidance and support, easing the strain on families like mine across Australia.

Support for caregivers is not just an investment in individuals like myself but in the wellbeing of our elderly population and the health of our communities nationwide. Your action can genuinely transform lives.

My name is Lisa Davies, and I am writing to you from Beaumaris. As a daughter and niece tasked with the care of my 94-year-old mother, 81-year-old aunt and 87-year-old uncle, I am deep in the challenges faced by many Australians in their roles as family caregivers. The weight of increased care needs and frequent medical visits has necessitated a reduction in my working hours, reshaping my life significantly.

The hours dedicated to navigating healthcare services, organising aged-care support, and ensuring my loved ones’ well-being are considerable. I find myself constantly torn between my responsibilities as a caregiver, maintaining a professional career, and my own personal needs. This challenge is amplified by the complex and sometimes inaccessible array of services available, making an already tough situation more arduous.

I believe that a structured assistance programme could transform my situation and the lives of countless others in similar circumstances. Support programs that help caregivers navigate health, aged care, and home care services, as well as assist in planning for the last stages of life, would be of immense benefit. Such provisions would not only aid in practical terms but also provide emotional support and guidance on having critical conversations about the future.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support the funding of a national caregiver program such as Violet's. This initiative would help alleviate the pressures and challenges faced by the 'Sandwich Generation' as we care for our ageing loved ones whilst juggling other life responsibilities. Your support could significantly influence our ability to care compassionately and effectively.

Over the past few years, my life has significantly shifted as I now balance a reduced work schedule with the complexities of elderly care.

Working four days a week and caring for my mother has introduced financial strains and emotional burdens that I hadn't anticipated. The most challenging aspect for me has been navigating this path without adequate support; there are moments when the lack of expert advice on how to manage her care effectively is palpable.

Such a program could offer not only practical guidance but also essential emotional support and help in navigating the complex aged care services. We need initiatives that recognise and address the unique challenges faced by family caregivers nationwide, ensuring that our elderly can live their later years with dignity and support.

Each day, I dedicate multiple hours to her care, managing everything from household tasks to ensuring she has some interaction with the world outside our home. This commitment has inevitably led to a significant reduction in my work hours and increased financial strain.

Living in the suburb of St Albans, our access to specialised aged care resources is limited, and navigating the available health services is a complex and time-consuming task. The support that would truly make a difference for us includes clearer, more accessible information on aged care and home care services—guidance that understands the unique challenges faced by those of us in less urban areas.

The reality is my world is getting smaller as I try to maintain the quality of life for my mother. The responsibilities of caring for her while managing financial pressures are immense. This scenario is not unique to me; it affects millions around the country, many of whom are part of the 'Sandwich Generation,' juggling care for elderly parents while supporting their own families.

The most strenuous aspect of this caregiving role has been the lack of assistance and resources available, which leaves me feeling overwhelmed and isolated. The physical and emotional toll this takes is enormous, and the strain it places on my ability to manage other aspects of my life, such as work and personal well-being, cannot be overstated.

Living in a suburban area like Dulwich Hill, the services and support for caregivers like myself, particularly those handling aged care, are not as robust as needed.

As the backbone for my parents while wrestling with work commitments and nurturing two teenage boys, I am a firsthand witness to the difficulties faced by those in my situation.

In July, we invited my parents to live with us, which was supposed to ease our caregiving burden. However, managing their health and navigating a labyrinthine aged care system has proved immensely exhausting. My father, who is living with blindness and dementia, and my mother, struggle with simple tasks, escalating their reliance on my immediate family. Despite my best efforts, services have been unreliable—frequently cancelling or rescheduling needed assistance, pushing us to sever ties with our care provider. Now, we face the daunting task of finding anew amidst the chaos of everyday life.

The most gruelling challenge, undeniably, is setting up aged care services. The delays and red tape effectively leave families like mine in a perpetual state of anxiety and fatigue. Direct and more accessible support with health, aged care, and home care services would immensely alleviate our burden.

I urge your office to champion Violet’s national program to assist families in managing the complexities of elderly care. Advocating for improved caregiver support nationally not only helps individual families but strengthens our community as Australia’s population ages.

My name is Amanda J Brown, residing in the suburb of Canterbury, and I am reaching out in my capacity as a dedicated caregiver to my elderly mother. Over the years, my role has dramatically shifted as I've found myself deeply involved in almost every aspect of her daily life—from managing her healthcare and household needs to addressing emergency situations. This includes liaising with aged care providers, hospitals, and utility companies, which often results in a relentless cycle of communication and coordination that sees no end.

The complexities of navigating the aged care system, paired with the instability of care plans which are frequently altered by care providers or not fully integrated among healthcare professionals, add significant stress to our lives. This systemic inefficiency not only affects my mother's well-being but also imposes a tremendous emotional and physical toll on myself, demonstrating a clear gap in the support provided to caregivers like me.

What would considerably alleviate this burden is streamlined access to and navigational assistance of health, aged care, and home care services. Thus, I implore you to advocate for enhancements in these systems nationally, and specifically to support initiatives such as Violet's national program.

This struggle happens under the roof of my also ageing mother, who refuses help despite her palpable exhaustion. Adding to the emotional weight of my situation, I am a single mother to a Year 12 student who also requires my attention and support.

The challenge of balancing these responsibilities is not unique to me but shared by countless Australians, often referred to as the ‘Sandwich Generation’.

This role has required her to leave her work and set aside her personal needs to be available around the clock in a rural setting 1.5 hours from our home.

My wife is an only child, and the weight of this responsibility is hers alone. This commitment has not only led to a complete halt in her professional life five years prematurely but has significantly affected her mental and emotional well-being. She experiences increased distress and feelings of entrapment as she navigates the complex demands of caregiving without adequate support.

Living in a rural setting, my mother requires consistent care, which I provide by commuting seven hours each month to stay with her. This arrangement gives my sibling a much-needed respite and allows me precious time with Mum, assisting her with daily activities and medical appointments while managing her Alzheimer's.

The travel and time required to provide this care significantly impact my work and family life. The frequent trips and the emotional toll of watching Alzheimer's affect my mother's life are overwhelming. Additionally, the lack of clear communication and empathy from aged care providers exacerbates the difficulties in managing her care and maintaining her quality of life.

The support systems currently in place do not adequately address the unique challenges faced by caregivers like myself, especially those of us in rural areas who must travel long distances to provide care. Clearer information and more empathetic engagement from aged care services would make a substantial difference, helping to alleviate the immense pressure on families.

Such initiatives are critical as they would offer essential guidance and support tailored to the complexities caregivers face, including those dealing with debilitating diseases like Alzheimer's and long-distance care challenges.

Over the past few years, my role has transitioned from being her daughter to being her primary caregiver. This change has been profound and challenging.  I generally was working 4 days a week as well.

My mother currently requires care in a hospital setting that is both overcrowded and understaffed, making it necessary for me to advocate for her and be there overnight & during the day as she has a mild to moderate dementia and was high functioning at home until her fall.  

I was strongly encouraged to not bring her to hospital as she is better at home & that goes without saying.  At home Mum became weaker each day 
over the course of the week with the pain increasing & her ability to walk declining.  

I'm at the hospital to ensure she receives the basic necessities such as food, and to encourage her proper nutrition.  Also to ensure her medication is considered carefully due to her dementia. The emotional and physical toll this takes on me is significant, impacting my own wellbeing.  I choose not to work during this phase as a result of the staffing & over-crowding issues.  

One of the toughest parts of this journey is the complexity of navigating health and aged care services. A streamlined system or support navigating these services would immensely relieve some of the pressures we face.

Each week, I dedicate over 30 hours to their care, managing everything from medical appointments to connecting them with our family's younger generations. This responsibility, which I shoulder without any carer's benefit for looking after my mother, has significant impacts on my life, including forcing me to give up my career.

Living in a regional area like ours only amplifies these challenges, with fewer resources and professionals equipped to handle complex cases such as dementia. The care facility, while a safe haven for Mum, does not alleviate the constant need for my involvement in managing her care and support.

The strain of this role is immense, and thus, I am reaching out to ask for your support in advocating for enhancements to caregiver support across Australia. A national program that helps families navigate health, aged care, and home care services more efficiently would provide significant relief for countless Australians like myself.

Your commitment to supporting caregivers can transform the lives of families facing the daunting task of elder care, making our community a more compassionate place for all. Thank you for considering this crucial issue.

My name is Tammy Hudson from Risdon Park South, and I write to you not only as a constituent but as a daughter and full-time carer for my father, Terry Hunter, aged 74. Since my mother's sudden passing last year and my dad's diagnosis with head and neck cancer, I have taken on the role of his sole caregiver. This role demands constant attention to his personal care, hygiene, nourishment, and financial management.

The transition to full-time caregiving while managing work and personal life has been incredibly stressful. The hardest part is the constant juggling of responsibilities and the emotional toll it takes, not just on me but on the whole family. Support in managing family dynamics, navigating health, aged care services, and planning for the last stages of life would make a substantial difference to our situation.

Living in a remote area like Risdon Park South further compounds these challenges, with limited access to specialised healthcare services and support systems. This is why I am calling on your advocacy for better support for caregivers not only in our community but across the nation.

I urge you to support funding for Violet’s national program which promises to offer practical guidance, emotional support, and assistance navigating the complexities of aged care. This initiative would greatly assist Australians like me, who balance caregiving with other life commitments, to provide compassionate care without losing ourselves in the process.

Thank you for considering this vital issue that affects so many of your constituents.

My name is Donna Bridges, from the suburb of 5558, and I am writing to share my experience and seek your support for an issue that affects many Australians. I care for my husband, Colin, who has early-onset dementia. We have been navigating this challenging path for the last ten years while simultaneously raising two of our grandchildren.

As Colin’s condition progresses, my role has become drastically more involved. I find myself continuously calming his distress about recurrent confusions like his surroundings, financial concerns, and even his recognition of me, despite our nearly 30 years of marriage. Our nights are interrupted multiple times as Colin wakes me or our teenage grandson with urgent cries for help because he cannot find me. This constant vigilance leaves no room for respite, not even for a few moments of peace in the garden.

This week we were informed of a decision to remove Colin as a carer for our grandson, whom he has raised since infancy. This change adds another layer of distress to our already strained family dynamics. Managing family tensions and navigating through these recurring crises have become my daily reality. Support in managing these intense family dynamics would make a substantial difference to our lives.

Given the increasing needs of Australia’s ageing population and the significant emotional and physical demands placed on caregivers, I urge you to advocate for more comprehensive support systems. Support for Violet’s national program would provide essential relief and resources to families like mine, helping us manage our roles more effectively and with much-needed support.

My name is Mandy Watson, and I have recently navigated the immensely challenging journey of providing palliative care for both of my parents in Port Augusta. Despite my efforts to allow them a peaceful departure at home, they both passed away in a hospital setting—an outcome that was against their final wishes.

The experience of caregiving, especially in a regional area like ours, highlights significant gaps in our healthcare system, particularly in the availability and accessibility of end-of-life care options. The lack of adequate support during this critical time not only compromised the quality of my parents' last days but also imposed a severe emotional and logistical burden on myself as a caregiver.

The biggest struggle was coordinating appropriate care and managing the emotional toll of seeing my parents not passing as they wished. This ordeal has led me to believe strongly in the necessity of better-planned end-of-life care. Support that caters to the unique challenges faced by individuals and families in rural and regional areas is crucial.

I urge you, along with your colleagues, to advocate for enhanced funding and development of resources such as Violet's national program. This program can provide much-needed support by offering practical guidance and emotional support, tailored to the specific needs of caregivers in similar situations across Australia.

Improving our support systems for the aging population and their caregivers is not just an investment in their welfare but in the strength and resilience of our communities at large.

My name is Yvonne Watts, and I am currently managing the escalating challenges of ageing while living in a regional area, postcode 4350. With age, my responsibilities for taking care of myself have intensified, particularly in maintaining physical and mental health, which is a near-daily struggle since the onset of COVID-19.

Accessing necessary services and maintaining an active lifestyle through gym visits, daily walks, and social engagements with friends and family have become pivotal to managing my health. However, the mental load of planning for future healthcare and living arrangements is daunting. The most substantial help would be supportive services that facilitate discussions around these pivotal planning stages, making an often overwhelming task more manageable.

Living remotely compounds these challenges, as specialised services are not as readily available or accessible compared to urban areas. This situation brings about feelings of isolation and difficulty in accessing immediate support when required.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for expanded support and resources for individuals like myself, particularly in rural and regional areas. Support for initiatives such as Violet's national program would immensely benefit by providing essential guidance and resources tailored to our unique needs.

This support will not only aid in managing our day-to-day health but also in navigating the complexities of ageing, ensuring that we can maintain our dignity and quality of life as we grow older.

I write to you both as a constituent from 4350 and as a devoted carer to my husband, who requires constant attention due to his health. Transitioning from a wife to a full-time carer has profoundly altered our lives and taken a significant emotional and physical toll on me.

Previously, I navigated life balancing personal health challenges, but now, my role as my husband’s primary caregiver has escalated these difficulties. The profound grief of losing not only my job but the previous dynamics of our relationship has been shattering. As I dedicate most of my day to care for him, the isolation and mental strain are beyond overwhelming.

Families in rural areas like ours face unique challenges, including limited access to support services, which intensify the difficulties of caregiving. The mental health support that could be provided by a national program like Violet’s is not just beneficial but necessary for carers like myself who find themselves mentally and physically stretched.

I urge you to advocate for and support the funding of Violet’s national program. Such a program would not only offer practical assistance and emotional support but would also ensure that carers, who play a crucial role in our health system, are not left to struggle alone. This support would represent a significant investment in the wellbeing of Australia’s aging population and their caregivers.

Thank you for considering this significant matter. I look forward to your support in creating a sustainable support system for carers nationwide.

My name is Aimee Barber, and I am writing to you from the heart of our community in Ellenbrook where I passionately fulfil my role as the primary caregiver for both my ageing parents. My mother, Yvonne, aged 77, is grappling with the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, and my father, Robert, 80, has become increasingly frail. Alongside this, I am raising my teenage son, Riley, who is 14.

The dual responsibility of caring for my elderly parents while nurturing a young life is a round-the-clock commitment that leaves little room for respite. It is akin to being a parent to my parents, especially my mother, whose condition demands constant vigilance and heartfelt patience. The transformation from daughter to caregiver has been profound and, at times, overwhelming.

The increasingly complex needs of my parents coincide with the daily challenges of raising a teenager, marking a deep impact on our family life. One of the hardest transitions has been the emotional toll of seeing my parents, who once cared for me, in such vulnerable states. The difficulty in navigating the myriad health, aged care, and home care services adds to our daily strain.

I urge you to consider supporting increased funding and resources for programmes like Violet's national program. This program is pivotal, offering practical guidance and robust support systems that could greatly assist caregivers like me, particularly in our rural community where resources are often stretched thin.

Your advocacy for this support will not only help our family but also thousands of others across the nation, ensuring we can provide our loved ones with the dignity and care they deserve as they age.

I am writing to you today not just as a constituent but as a daughter watching her mother, aged 78, transform before her eyes. Over the past few years, my role in my mother's life has drastically changed. What was once a relationship of mutual support has turned into full-time caregiving, from keeping visual aids around our home to organising all of her medical and personal care appointments.

The reversal of roles between my mother and me has been swift and challenging. It demands much time and emotional energy, detracting significantly from my own work and personal life. Watching her become so dependent is a source of deep emotional distress; it's like meeting a new person each day where my mother used to be.

Managing the multitude of tasks to ensure her well-being has illustrated a stark gap in support for caregivers. The emotional toll and time commitment are overwhelming, and navigating health, aged care, and home care services without clear, accessible support makes these challenges even harder.

Thus, I advocate strongly for your support of Violet’s national program. This initiative would provide invaluable guidance and resources, assisting caregivers like myself to manage better the complex needs of an ageing parent. Access to such support would not only help in balancing our personal lives but also in preserving the mental health and well-being of both caregivers and their loved ones.

Your backing for this program will not only support families like mine but also prepare us as a nation for the increasing demands of an ageing population.

The transformation from daughter to primary caregiver has been profound and challenging. The hardest part was depleting my annual and sick leave, grappling to maintain my professional responsibilities while ensuring my mother's comfort and dignity during her final days. This juggling act brought to light the stark reality facing many Australians, especially those in the 'Sandwich Generation' caring for both parents and children.

The strain of caregiving is immense, and support systems that facilitate significant conversations and decision-making for end-of-life care are crucial. We, as a nation, need structured programs that address the practical and emotional challenges faced by family caregivers. 

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support Violet's national program, which aims to provide essential guidance and support for caregivers. By endorsing this initiative, you will help alleviate the profound burden on families across Australia, ensuring they do not face these challenging times unsupported.

Every day, I navigate the stressful intersection of caring for an elderly parent while raising my children, reflecting the reality of many Australians caught in the duties of the 'Sandwich Generation'.

My father lives a challenging 45-minute drive away, requiring frequent time off from work to manage his needs. The strain on my time—once spent on my children and for respite—is now consumed by managing his health and well-being. The hardest part is grappling alone with an opaque care system, finding every decision weighed heavily on unsupported shoulders.

The immense responsibility of caring without adequate support prevents me not only from being fully present for my children but also from maintaining my own well-being. It is clear that navigating health, aged care, and home care services should not be an isolating battle.

For families like mine, especially those spread across greater distances, a structured program like Violet’s national initiative could provide a lifeline. Such support would greatly assist us in managing the complex and multifaceted challenges of elder care.

I write to you not only as your constituent but as a primary caregiver confronted with the formidable challenge of supporting my father, Ron, who is currently struggling with dementia. At 73, his condition has deteriorated to the point that he requires constant care, a situation which has placed immense stress on my own mental health and employment.

Until recently, I balanced a full-time job while caring for my father, which led to a significant decline in my mental well-being. I faced daily frustration, anger, and guilt, as I grappled with providing him the care he required. The situation escalated to a critical point, resulting in my job termination due to numerous absences needed to manage his care—a situation made worse by a disjointed government service system that fails to communicate effectively across its own channels.

Presently, my father is hospitalised as I navigate the complexities of securing an aged care home for him, a task daunted by intricate legal and financial challenges. This experience has taught me the urgent need for a unified approach to handling health, aged care, and home care services, which could significantly alleviate the stress for caregivers like myself.

It is paramount that the government recognises the unique challenges faced by individuals caring for elderly parents in Australia. I urge you to advocate for enhanced national caregiver support, including significant backing for better-integrated services that would allow caregivers to provide the necessary care without compromising their livelihood and well-being.

My name is Vicki Andrew, and I'm reaching out from the perspective of someone deeply entrenched in the challenging role of caregiving. My mother, May, aged 83, suffers from dementia, and ensuring her wellbeing has become the focal point of my life. Over recent years, I've transitioned from daughter to primary caregiver, now responsible for all her medical and personal decision-making.

Each week involves 4 hours of travel to see my mother, a sacrifice of time further compounded by the administrative maze of Centrelink and health service coordination. Educated and once professionally employed, I find the bureaucracy baffling and disheartening. This has led me to leave my job and forgo moving plans to be available for her—choices demonstrating the significant toll caregiving exacts on personal and professional fronts.

One of the hardest aspects of this journey is being unable to keep May in her familiar home environment due to her care needs, a sentiment that many other caregivers across Australia can resonate with. For those like me, especially in rural settings where services can be sparse, the strain is amplified.

Therefore, I urge you not only to recognise but advocate for enhanced supports for caregivers managing the balancing act of caring for elderly parents. Support in navigating the intricate systems of health, aged care, and home service would be invaluable. We need robust, streamlined pathways to access services without the accompanying emotional and logistical burdens.

Your advocacy in Parliament for improvements and perhaps the endorsement of initiatives like Violet's national program could undeniably transform lives, providing necessary respite and guidance to Australia's ageing population and their caregivers.

I am now facing carer's fatigue, diagnosed by a psychologist, and the immense financial pressure of an uncertain future, including the potential sale of our family home.

Caring for Nanna involves overseeing home care, managing medical appointments, and restructuring our home space, all while balancing family life which includes five adult children and their partners, and grandchildren.

My mother, aged 84, is battling dementia, and my father, 88, has a host of severe health issues including a heart condition necessitating a triple bypass and a pacemaker, and he relies on a walker for mobility. Their care demands are profound and continuous, placing immense pressure on us, both emotionally and financially.

Being self-funded retirees who are not pensioners, my parents find themselves in a precarious financial situation, receiving minimal government support despite having contributed to the system their entire lives. It's an unfair predicament that forces my siblings and I to take significant unpaid leave from work, straining our finances and emotional wellbeing. This scenario is exacerbated by residing in a community where specialised healthcare and aged care resources are scarce and expensive.

We have urgently needed assistance for seven months, waiting on the ACAT emergency list, but progress is slow and resources seem just out of reach. The means-testing for care packages complicates access to affordable services even more, putting decent care further out of our reach.

This situation isn't unique to us. It reflects the hardships faced by countless Australian families, particularly in rural and regional areas. We urgently need comprehensive support to navigate health, aged care, and home care services that are both accessible and affordable.

In our small community in the 5021 postcode area, my daily life revolves around caring for Brodie 24/7.

One significant hurdle we face is the lack of local support and resources that can assist in managing these changes effectively. Guidance on how to have necessary and difficult conversations about care preferences and future health directives would be invaluable. This kind of support is scarce in regional areas like ours, where healthcare services are limited and less accessible.

I implore you and your colleagues to advocate for improvements in caregiver support on a national level, particularly for those of us in rural and regional locations. By backing initiatives such as Violet's national program, you have the power to substantially ease the burden on families like mine, ensuring that we can provide compassionate care without compromising our own health.

This would not only support our ageing population more sustainably but also acknowledge and bolster the enduring love and commitment that family caregivers offer every day across Australia.

My name is Sharon Prescott, and I live in postcode 4655 where I care for my 84-year-old father. Over the past few years, my role as his daughter has transformed significantly—I now find myself acting more like a parent to him, constantly having to advocate for, arrange, and sometimes directly provide his care due to gaps in available services. 

In our rural location, the challenge of accessing consistent and reliable support services is greatly intensified. Many times, I've had to step in to resolve issues created by the inadequacies of these services, which should ostensibly be helping us. This ongoing struggle not only demands a large amount of time but also places emotional and practical strains on our daily lives.

The hardest part of this journey has been the unreliable nature of support services. The inconsistency often leaves me fixing more problems than the services alleviate, impacting my ability to maintain any semblance of a personal life and adding significant stress. Effective support navigating the complex maze of health, aged care, and home care services would greatly benefit us, allowing me to provide better care for my father without constantly battling systemic inefficiencies.

Therefore, I am urging you to advocate for enhanced support systems for caregivers, particularly through backing Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to provide not just practical guidance and emotional support, but also crucial assistance in navigating aged care services—a lifeline for families like mine in rural Australia.

Our elderly deserve dignity, and their caregivers need empowerment to sustain this critical role in our community.

I am reaching out amid the profound challenges I face as a full-time carer for my husband, Anthony, who has recently become totally dependent on my care. Every day, I grapple with immense responsibilities, balancing Anthony's meticulous personal care routines with the relentless emotional toll it takes on us both. The journey through caregiving has been particularly marked by significant anxiety and frustration.

We reside in an area where accessing specialised health and aged care services is constantly overwhelming, given the complexity of systems and the scarcity of resources tailored to our unique needs. The assistance to efficiently navigate health, aged care, and home care services in our community would tremendously alleviate our burden. 

Thus, I urge you to support and advocate for Violet's national program. This initiative is critical as it promises to provide caregivers like myself not just with practical guidance, but also with essential emotional support and a streamlined approach to accessing necessary services. Our ageing population underscores the urgency of this support, as more Australians will undoubtedly face similar caregiving challenges.

My father, Greg, aged 65, has been diagnosed with brain cancer, dramatically shifting our roles and the dynamics of our relationship. Now, the weight of arranging everything from his medical appointments to daily meals and general life management rests on my shoulders.

The enormity of this responsibility is compounded by the ongoing challenge of finding resources and support suited to our needs, especially in planning for the final stages of his life. Each day is a battle against the relentless tide of appointments, treatments, and administrative tasks necessary to maintain his quality of life.

Currently, I strive to maintain a balance between living in Sydney and visiting my elderly relatives in Bowral, which poses considerable emotional and logistical challenges.

The most pressing difficulty I encounter is not being able to spend as much quality time with them due to the pressures of distance and a busy family schedule. This aspect of our lives has intensified over the years, especially given the health considerations that naturally arise with aging. Managing these family dynamics, particularly during times of stress or when there are disagreements among family members, has become increasingly complex.

Support services that facilitate better management of family dynamics and provide guidance during stressful periods would be immensely beneficial. These resources would not only aid in easing emotional strains but also enhance the quality of care we can provide, despite the geographical distances involved.

I humbly urge you to advocate for and support the expansion of initiatives such as Violet’s national program. Such programs are crucial in offering practical and emotional support to families like mine, enabling us to better navigate the intricacies of caring for aging loved ones. Your backing of these initiatives would significantly impact improving elder care throughout Australia, supporting the well-being of both the elderly and their caregivers.

My mother, 76, struggles with dementia, and my father, 79, faces significant mobility issues. Their care is a constant presence in my day—managing endless appointments with doctors, aged care services, RNs, therapists, as well as my parents personal hygiene tasks such as showering, shaving, applying first aid, all the while trying to maintain my own mental and emotional health, raise a family, keep a marriage, study at uni, begin my career as a teacher, the list goes on.

The hardest part is the emotional toll it takes, having to suppress my own feelings to stay functional in all the other areas of my life. This emotional balancing act is something I find overwhelmingly exhausting, and I often find myself wondering about the sustainability and support available for people like me.

This leads me to advocate for a stronger support system that could be facilitated through robust programs like Violet’s national program. Such initiatives could provide immense relief by offering comprehensive guidance, emotional support, and significant help with navigating complex aged care services.

Therefore, I urge you to lend your support for funding and endorsing programs that understand and address the nuanced demands of families juggling caregiving with their personal and professional lives. Enhancing these support systems is not only crucial for improving the quality of life for Australia’s ageing population and their caregivers it is saving the government a significant amount of money in care fees.

Following my divorce two years ago I have been managing his daily needs largely on my own. This encompasses a wide array of tasks including managing our household, coordinating with healthcare services, and ensuring his overall well-being.

The most overwhelming part of this role is the constant mental strain and the exhaustive nature of the paperwork involved with multiple organisations like NDIS, DJC Housing, and Centrelink. The complexity of these systems makes it incredibly challenging to navigate, often leaving me exhausted and stressed.

To better support caregivers like me, who tirelessly work to manage their loved ones' health along with their personal responsibilities, it is essential that more accessible and intuitive support programs are put in place. Guidance on navigating health, aged care, and home care services, coupled with help managing family dynamics under stress, would significantly impact our lives.

I am currently tasked with the care of my dear mother, Coral Richardson, who is 88 years old and battling dementia. This role challenges me deeply, not only due to her increasing medical needs but also because of the emotional pain of watching her lose her independence.

Caring for Mum involves coordinating with carers for her mornings, while my sister and I manage her meals and bedtime routines. This responsibility is in addition to my full-time job and my own family duties. The mental and physical toll it takes to juggle these roles is significant. Witnessing Mum's decline and manoeuvring through the complexities of the aged care system adds another layer of stress.

Nearly four years ago, following the deaths of my husband and father, I became the primary carer for my elderly mother, Colleen Slatter, aged 91. As a part-time hospital worker, the majority of my time is dedicated to her care.

The transition from grieving widow to full-time carer has been overwhelming. My emotional wellbeing has been profoundly impacted by the loss of my husband and the immediate weight of my mother's needs.

Our life significantly changed as we moved from making occasional visits to becoming their full-time carers. This role shift has placed enormous strain on us, emotionally and physically, leading me to an overwhelming situation where I needed admission to a psychiatric facility.

Living in a regional area adds complexity to my situation, with limited local healthcare services and support networks for someone in my condition. The challenges I face daily in accessing required services not only exhaust me physically but also strain me emotionally. The profound sense of losing myself and my autonomy is the hardest part of this journey.

Adequate caregiver support services in regional areas like mine are a dire necessity. Many Australians share a similar plight, where geographical isolation compounds the difficulties in managing health and maintaining dignity in later life without adequate support.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for improved policy measures and funding dedicated to support services for elderly and dependent individuals across rural, regional, and remote Australia. Your support for programs like Violet's national program could tremendously enhance the quality of life for many, providing essential guidance, resources, and emotional support to navigate these challenging times effectively.

Thank you for considering this crucial issue that deeply affects the lives of many of your constituents.

I am Lynne Scanlan, a resident of [Suburb, postcode], and I write to you as a daughter and a caregiver to my mother, Charlotte Scanlan, who is 91 years old. For the past few years, mother has been residing in an aged care facility where I am intricately involved in making significant medical decisions on her behalf. Witnessing my mum’s ageing process has been profoundly challenging, both emotionally and mentally. 

One of the toughest aspects of this journey has been planning and managing the care needed during the last stages of her life. This task is overwhelming and highlights a significant area where additional support could make a substantial difference not just for me, but for many Australians in similar circumstances. Support with planning for life’s final stages, including navigational help with aged care services and emotional support, would provide substantial relief.

I urge you and your fellow members to advocate for enhanced national support for caregivers. Our ageing population necessitates a robust framework to support not just the elderly but those who care for them. Specific guidance on end-of-life planning should be part of this framework to ensure dignity and appropriate care during the most vulnerable times.

By endorsing and supporting the funding for initiatives like Violet’s national program, we can provide caregivers with the necessary tools to manage these emotional and complex situations more effectively. Such support is not just a benefit but a necessity for a compassionate society.

Yours faithfully,

I am Michelle, caring full-time for my elderly mother in the rural area of postcode 4888. The recent loss of my father has not only added emotional strain but also increased the support required by my mother, significantly impacting our lives. My daily efforts to maintain her dignity and manage her evolving health needs have revealed the harsh realities of accessing appropriate aged care services in remote locations.

The greatest pain is seeing the person who once took care of me grappling with profound social isolation and complex health issues, without timely support. This not only diminishes her quality of life but also places immense stress on me, affecting my own financial security and future retirement.

The availability of resources and navigational help through health, aged care, and home care services could alleviate much of the hardship we face. Yet, the specific challenges of our rural setting—such as delayed support services—exacerbate these difficulties, leading to a loss of dignity and increasing dependency.

I am urging you to advocate for enhanced support systems for the Sandwich Generation, who simultaneously juggle caregiving for parents and their own personal obligations. Specifically, I request your backing for Violet’s national program, which aims to offer essential guidance and emotional support, making navigation of aged care services more accessible for families like mine.

Supporting this program would represent a significant step towards acknowledging and addressing the unique challenges faced by rural caregivers across Australia, ensuring no one is disadvantaged by their geographical location.

My name is Annette Fay Burns, and I reside in the suburb of Thuringowa Central, postcode 4817. As part of what's often called the 'Sandwich Generation,' I am currently navigating the escalating responsibilities of caring for my mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's whilst also supporting my granddaughter. 

In recent years, my role has evolved from being a granddaughter and daughter to an essential support person - managing visits, outings, household chores, and yard maintenance for my mother. The weight of these responsibilities compelled me to quit my job, leading to burnout and a pressing need to focus on my own wellbeing.

Residing in a regional area, the challenges are compounded by limited access to specialised healthcare services and support networks for caregivers like myself. The emotional and physical toll is significant - losing my career was devastating, and the daily struggle with my mother's condition and maintaining a household is overwhelming.

A national program, such as Violet's, offering practical guidance, emotional support, and efficient navigation of aged care services, would be invaluable. Such a program would furnish caregivers with the resources needed to manage care more effectively, thus ensuring our elderly loved ones receive the care they deserve.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced support for caregivers across Australia, with a keen focus on those in rural, regional, and remote areas. Our ageing population necessitates this, and it is imperative that we act now to support individuals who dedicate themselves to caring for others, just as I do.

My name is Kelly Wing, and I reside in the suburb of Thuringowa. I am deeply invested in providing end-of-life care to several clients, a role that has significantly expanded over recent years. Each day, I face challenges determining if the support I provide is sufficient, and it's a responsibility that bears a complex mixture of reward and relentless doubt.

The most arduous part of my daily role involves navigating the intricacies of health, aged care, and home care services. Ensuring each client receives compassionate, competent, and personalised care requires a nuanced understanding of available resources, which often feels overwhelming due to the scarcity of streamlined support systems.

With Australia's ageing population, the demand for end-of-life care will only grow, intensifying the need for comprehensive support networks that can guide carers like myself through the complexities of service systems. Enhanced support would not only improve our ability to provide care but also our clients' quality of life.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for funding for Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to offer essential guidance, emotional support, and assistance navigating aged care services, ensuring carers are equipped to manage their responsibilities effectively.

My name is Lee Woma from the suburb of Malanda, postcode 4883. I am currently navigating the complex role of a full-time caregiver not only to my husband, whose disability is sadly not recognised by formal agencies, but also providing support to my son who faces mental health challenges. Looking ahead, the responsibility of caring for my aging parents looms near, adding to my already substantial duties.

The journey of caregiving is one marked by escalating demands; my husband’s needs are growing rapidly, and the support systems seem labyrinthine and unyielding. Despite 17 years of effort, the absence of adequate assistance has left us contemplating distressing future prospects, including potential separation as he may need to enter a care facility far from our home.

Residing in a regional area compounds these challenges, where services are less accessible, reducing our options and increasing the likelihood of isolation. My own health issues add another layer of difficulty to navigating these systems, and the emotional toll is immense.

It is clear that caregivers like myself, particularly those in regional settings, require more than piecemeal solutions; we need comprehensive support that addresses both immediate and long-term caregiving challenges. A program such as Violet's national initiative would be invaluable, offering guidance and support in managing health, aged care, and home care services effectively.

I urge you, as a representative vested with the power to effect change, to advocate for the support of this program. It would not only transform the quality of life for caregivers and their families but would also prepare our society to meet the growing needs as Australia’s population ages.

Ensuring my mother receives the nutritious meals she needs, along with her daily medications, and attending to all her shopping needs requires a dedication that stretches me to my limits.

Due to my mother's increasing needs, we recently moved closer to provide her with the necessary support. Each week, I dedicate approximately ten hours to her care, coordinating her needs amid my work responsibilities and parenting duties. 

The hardest part of this arrangement is managing my career alongside my caregiving responsibilities, which takes a toll emotionally and practically. It is a constant juggle, and I often find myself wrestling with concerns about the future care of my mother and the impact on my children.

I write to you not only as a constituent but as a daughter deep in the throes of navigating care for my elderly parents in Botany. My mother Angela, aged 81, who courageously battles dementia, and my father Richard, also 81, struggles with lung disease and cancer. Caring for them has fundamentally altered my role as their child, demonstrably increasing the hours I dedicate each week to managing medical appointments, tackling labyrinthine administrative tasks, and providing critical emotional support.

The toll of doubling as a caregiver while being a mother to young children is incredibly challenging. My children are missing out on forming cherished memories with their grandparents, and despite my best efforts, the demands often stretch me painfully thin between my responsibilities.

This hardship is exacerbated by the arduous task of navigating our healthcare system and securing appropriate aged care. Clear, streamlined support in dealing with health, aged care, and home care services would significantly alleviate the burdens that families like mine carry daily.

In addition to holding a leadership position at work, I am also balancing the responsibilities of motherhood with two teenage daughters. Every day is a relentless juggle, trying to manage mum's finances, medical appointments, and household needs, while also meeting my professional and family commitments.

The time I spend caring for my mum is intense and often leaves both of us feeling drained.

The hours I spend caring for my mother are filled with challenges, from managing her health needs to ensuring her daily comfort and safety.

In recent years, my mother's condition has evolved to include high anxiety and early onset dementia, compounding the challenges we face.

The prospect of managing her care remotely while juggling professional responsibilities and my immediate family's needs is daunting. The hardest aspects are the scarcity of time, accessible information, and the substantive financial burden. We're in a difficult limbo, assessing the viability between independent living, which varies state by state, and national aged care services, which themselves are not straightforward.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced national support systems by funding programs like Violet's national initiative. Such programs are vital in offering practical and emotional support and guidance in navigating the aged care services maze. 

Better support for caregivers not only helps families but enriches our community by allowing our elderly to maintain their dignity and quality of life at home.

Thank you for considering this crucial issue.

My name is Leanne Davis and I reside in the suburb of Clyde, postcode 3978. I am writing to you as both a daughter and a caregiver to my 84-year-old mother, Deanna. Over the past few years, my responsibilities towards my mother have significantly increased—she requires assistance for everything from transportation to managing daily tasks and understanding complex information due to her cognitive decline.

Each week, I dedicate over eight hours to her care while also balancing my own employment and supporting adult children with mental health challenges. This multifaceted role has not only placed a strain on my personal well-being but has led to financial losses as my sick leave depletes with every medical appointment I attend with my mum.

The relentless demand of caregiving has transformed my role from a daughter to that of an adviser, advocate, and coordinator. This shift, while necessary, has been both emotionally and physically taxing.

In order to alleviate some of the challenges faced by individuals like myself, especially those in similar 'Sandwich Generation' caregiving situations, I urge our government to recognise and provide added support. Specifically, funding for initiatives like Violet's national program could greatly benefit carers by offering guidance on managing family dynamics and resolving conflicts, often exacerbated under stress. Such support not only aids in preserving the carer’s health but also enhances the quality of care provided to our ageing population.

I kindly request your support in advocating for better caregiver support systems at the national level, increasing the resources available to help us navigate these responsibilities more sustainably.

Yours sincerely,

My name is Simone Waterman, and I am reaching out to share my situation as a full-time carer for my 72-year-old mother, Judy, who suffers from dementia. We recently had to move her from interstate to live with us in 3978, and it has been distressing to witness her rapid decline, exacerbated by a major accident. The emotional and physical toll on our family is substantial, with both my sons pitching in to fill care gaps due to insufficient support hours. This impact ripples through our work and school lives, straining our ability to manage.

One of the greatest challenges we face is navigating the complexities of health, aged care, and home care services, which seems almost insurmountable without additional guidance and support. My mother's needs are increasing, and so are the demands on my family to provide care, which we do out of love but at a significant personal and emotional cost.

I am writing to ask for your support in advocating for funding Violet's national program designed to aid families like mine. Such a program would offer crucial guidance and support, making a profound difference in our ability to care for our aging loved ones while maintaining our health, careers, and family life.

The need for a structured support system has never been more critical. I urge you to consider the plight of families nationwide juggling these responsibilities and to advocate for better support for caregivers across Australia as our population ages.

I am Adele Hall Fitz from Truganina, caring for my 74-year-old mother, Vicki, who is not just my parent but my closest friend. Over the past two years, the journey with my mother has transformed profoundly due to her aging needs, significantly impacting our relationship dynamics. The roles have reversed; I am now not just her daughter but also her caretaker, which brings incredibly challenging moments.

The hardest part of this transition is the feeling of loss—losing the vivacious and independent woman she once was. Supporting Mum requires constant effort, from managing health appointments to addressing her daily needs, which has placed substantial emotional and time commitments on my shoulders. However, the clear-cut roadmaps for navigating health, aged care, and home care services are what I'm lacking. This guidance is crucial not only for our family's well-being but also in ensuring Mum's dignity and quality of life.

I am reaching out to you today to endorse and support the funding for Violet’s national program. This initiative is pivotal in providing caregivers like myself, the substantial support needed in navigating the aged care system effectively. It promises not only to ease the burden by offering practical and emotional assistance but to ensure that caregivers can maintain their well-being as they care for their loved ones.

We are at the forefront of an ageing population, and our family's story is but one of many facing similar challenges across Australia. By supporting Violet's program, we can offer a safety net to millions, ensuring that dignity, respect, and care remain paramount as our loved ones age.

I am Gail Briffa, reaching out from my home in postcode 3029, as I navigate the daily challenges of caring for my elderly mother. My role as her primary caregiver has grown significantly as she has become more dependent over recent years. This commitment not only demands my presence daily but also encroaches upon my responsibilities to my own family and job, creating a delicate balance that is increasingly difficult to maintain.

The toughest part of this role is not just the lack of time, but the emotional toll it takes when trying to mediate between stressed family members who may not always agree on the best course of care. The constant negotiation and emotional management are exhausting and take away from the quality time that could be spent with both my mother and children.

This experience is not unique to me; it mirrors the struggles of many Australians in similar circumstances. We are the 'Sandwich Generation,' caught between caring for our aging parents and our children, desperate for support systems that understand and mitigate the multifaceted pressures we face.

I am writing to urge your support for Violet's national program, which could provide invaluable support to caregivers like myself. A program that offers guidance on managing family dynamics and practical help with day-to-day caregiving would be a beacon for many. We need implemented strategies that can assist us in balancing these intense demands without losing ourselves in the process.

Please advocate for better caregiver support nationally, as our population ages and more Australians find themselves in roles similar to mine.

My name is Barb Taylor, and I’m currently living in Tarneit, postcode 3029, caring for my 77-year-old mother, Annette. As my mum ages, I've taken the step to move back in with her to provide the necessary support during her twilight years. 

I face the prospect of her declining health with a mix of determination and apprehension. The most daunting aspect is anticipating the increased demand for care and navigating the suggestions and opinions of extended family members on her care plan. A structured support system that aids in planning for end-of-life stages would greatly ease this burden. 

Carers like me often find themselves straddling between personal obligations and our caregiving duties. This ‘Sandwich Generation’ bears a unique set of challenges, balancing work and our own family’s needs with those of our elderly loved ones. National support, such as the proposed program by Violet, is crucial. It promises to offer practical guidance, emotional support, and help in navigating aged care services, which would be invaluable to our family and many others.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support funding for Violet’s national program. This initiative would not only support elderly Australians but also provide much-needed relief to families like mine, ensuring we can manage better without having to compromise on our professional or personal responsibilities.

Your consideration can lead to significant positive changes in the lives of many Australian families.

My name is Antoinette Brandi, and I reside in the regional area of postcode 4877. I am writing to you not only as a constituent but as a caregiver deeply entrenched in the challenges of caring for my 95-year-old mother, Patricia Brandi, who requires significant support. In addition, I also have responsibilities towards my sister who suffers from dementia, alongside providing childcare for my two grandchildren. My role spans from managing medical appointments and finances to coordinating care—a constellation of duties that stretch my capacity daily.

The challenges of rural caregiving are manifold; access to adequate medical services and support facilities for both my mother and sister is not only limited but also exhausting to coordinate. Furthermore, balancing these responsibilities with family dynamics, where stress often leads to disagreements, exacerbates the emotional toll on everyone involved.

The introduction of a comprehensive program like Violet's national initiative could significantly unburden caregivers like myself by providing essential guidance and emotional support, and by streamlining access to aged care services. This would not only improve our quality of life but would also enhance the care we provide to our loved ones.

I am calling on you to advocate for better caregiver support at the national level, recognising the unique challenges faced by rural caregivers, and to support funding for initiatives that address these needs. As our population continues to age, it is imperative that we fortify our systems to support the enduring love and commitment that caregivers exert every day.

My name is Jodie Henley from Bonnie Doon, and I find myself in the challenging role of caring for my father, Joe D'Addona, who is 76. Following the recent loss of my mother to cancer after a 6.5-year battle, both my father and I are navigating our profound grief. Despite his chronic neck pain and other health ailments, my father continues to work on our family farm. While he remains active, the burdens of his health and his heartache are evident.

As a full-time worker with extensive financial commitments, including two mortgages, the pressure to balance work and care for my father weighs heavily on me. I'm deeply concerned about his chronic pain management and emerging memory issues, and these add to our daily challenges. Supporting him with day-to-day tasks like banking and cooking is becoming increasingly difficult amid my own work and life responsibilities.

The isolation and lack of specialised services in rural settings like ours compound these challenges, making it critical to have better support systems in place. I believe national initiatives like Violet’s program could provide crucial guidance and emotional support, as well as assistance in navigating health, aged care, and home care services—resources that are particularly scarce in rural areas.

I urge you to advocate for and support the establishment of comprehensive support programs that can alleviate the burdens on caregivers like myself, trying to provide dignified care to our loved ones while managing our own lives.

While he has not yet faced a significant health crisis, the minor signs of his aging, such as forgetfulness and repetition, are a constant source of concern for me and my family. Our hope is to enable both him and my mother to live out their final years in the familiar comfort of their own home, surrounded by loved ones, rather than in a clinical setting.

One of the most onerous tasks has been organising their home—downsizing and preparing for any potential urgent needs without stripping them of their independence or dignity. The uncertainty looming over us about future care requirements and suitable living arrangements is overwhelming. Like countless others in my situation, particularly in regional areas like ours where resources can be scarce, the emotional toll and the strain on our time are incessant.

I am asking for your support in advocating for national initiatives like Violet’s program, which can provide indispensable guidance, support, and resources to families like mine who are grappling with the complexities of elder care.

I am reaching out amidst the challenging care situation of my 88-year-old mother, Norma, who suffers from Alzheimer's dementia. My mother resides in a small rural community, and her care primarily falls to my brother, sister, and sister-in-law.

Balancing my role as a caregiver with my full-time position at a local public hospital is increasingly demanding. Securing leave to visit my mother—a necessity for both her well-being and mine—has been met with criticism and disbelief by my employer. This has added a heavy layer of guilt and stress to my responsibilities, amplifying the emotional burden of my caregiving role.

The logistical challenges of caregiving from a distance are immense. My family and I struggle not only with the emotional strain but also with navigating the complexities of health, aged care, and home care services in a regional area. These challenges are compounded by a lack of sufficient support and resources tailored to the unique needs of rural carers like us.

I am writing to share the realities of my life as a primary caregiver for my 78-year-old mother, Maureen Cartwright, who in her advanced age now relies on me for nearly everything. Every Sunday, what used to be a day of rest is now a full-day commitment assisting her with groceries, bills, medications, and more. Her inability to perform these tasks independently not only takes a toll on her but significantly on me as well.

The most challenging part of this role is not simply the time it consumes or the physical fatigue but the emotional strain. As Maureen's frustrations grow with her declining capabilities, I often find myself the target of her outbursts. This emotional turmoil is a common yet often unspoken hardship faced by many caregivers in my position.

Living in Kingswood, postcode 2747, and caring for an elderly parent single-handedly has highlighted a significant gap in support for those of us in suburban and regional areas, who must balance care with other responsibilities at home and work. The journey is isolating, with little professional support accessible to manage my mother's condition and our mutual emotional well-being.

It is with this personal backdrop that I urge your consideration for enhanced caregiver support systems. Specifically, support for planning the final stages of life and programs that can help manage both the logistical and emotional challenges of caregiving. Implementing robust support networks, including initiatives like Violet's national program, would offer tremendous relief and practical assistance to countless Australians in similar situations.

Caregiving is an act of love, but it shouldn't be a pathway to personal struggle. Your advocacy on this matter could fundamentally change the lives of Australia's aging population and those who care for them.

As a 73-year-old individual grappling with severe COPD, I am both my own caregiver and the very subject of care. I face immense challenges handling daily chores and self-care, often confined to extended periods of bed rest to recuperate from basic activities. The absence of any support amplifies the hardships, leaving me to navigate the complexities of health and aged care alone.

Over the years, the responsibility of caring for her has intensified, requiring me to manage not only her medical needs but also provide financial support and overnight care.

Balancing these demands alongside my own personal and work life has been increasingly challenging. The greatest difficulties I face include maintaining my self-care and managing the financial strain due to the costs associated with medications and doctors’ visits.

It's evident that many Australians are in similar circumstances, struggling to provide for ageing or disabled loved ones while also trying to sustain their own livelihood.

A structured program offering both emotional support and practical guidance would be invaluable, helping us navigate the intricacies of caregiving without compromising our health and financial stability.

The lack of local, accessible services heightens the burden, emphasising the need for enhanced support structures that can relieve the logistical and emotional pressures faced by caregivers.

I am writing to advocate for national backing of Violet’s program, which aims to support individuals like myself who are navigating the complexities of caring for loved ones while managing personal grief and mental health. This program would offer vital guidance, emotional support, and practical assistance, significantly impacting our ability to sustain our caregiving roles without compromising our health.

I urge you to consider the profound benefits that such a program would entail for caregivers nationwide, aiding us in continuing our invaluable roles within our families and communities.

My name is Wendy Joy, and I am currently the primary caregiver for my elderly parents in Launceston, Tasmania. At 87, my mother suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and my father, although a year younger, increasingly relies on my support for daily tasks such as showering, dressing, and understanding the complexities of today's world.

Balancing full-time work with the demands of caregiving is an ongoing struggle. The emotional toll of watching my parents' health decline, coupled with the logistical challenge of managing their care, leaves me feeling stretched beyond my limits.

The hardest part is the intimacy of tasks, like showering and dressing my parents, which is emotionally and physically draining. This role shift has made our relationship more complex and sometimes heartbreaking.

The need for accessible and intuitive guidance on navigating health, aged care, and home care services in regional areas like ours is urgent. Improved support services would not only assist in managing the logistical aspects of caregiving but also alleviate some of the emotional weight that caregivers like myself carry.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced support systems for the ‘Sandwich Generation’—those of us caught between caring for ageing parents and managing our other responsibilities. This support is crucial in ensuring we do not have to choose between our parents' welfare and our livelihoods.

Please consider pushing for the funding and development of Violet’s national program to provide much-needed relief and assistance to family caregivers across the country. Your support can make a significant difference in the lives of countless Australian families facing similar challenges.

The responsibility of caregiving fell more heavily on my shoulders after the passing of my father-in-law, escalating both the financial and administrative burdens we face daily.

Caring for my family members has become an all-encompassing task that leaves me mentally exhausted. I navigate complex health care decisions, particularly as my mother prefers to stay out of hospital settings despite her advancing needs. Balancing these responsibilities while managing familial tensions and differing opinions on care strategies is particularly straining.

I am reaching out to highlight the critical need for structured support that can help families like mine manage the emotional and logistical challenges of caregiving. Support programs that offer advice on handling family dynamics and stress would be invaluable. Furthermore, increased funding for carer support networks, particularly in rural areas like ours, could significantly alleviate the pressure on caregivers who often feel isolated and overwhelmed.

I urge you to advocate for and support the expansion of Violet’s national program. Such an initiative would not only provide practical guidance and emotional support but also equip families to better navigate the complexities of aged care. Your commitment to enhancing caregiver support will profoundly impact many Australians and help address the challenges we face as our population ages.

My name is Wendy Theiss from Campbelltown, postcode 2560, and I am writing to you today not just on my behalf but for all Australians caring for their elderly loved ones in rural or regional areas. I am a full-time caregiver to my 78-year-old mother, Mavis Collins, who increasingly relies on my support due to her aging-related needs. Each week, I dedicate six hours to manage her care, including navigating complex ACAT assessments, which is an emotional and logistical challenge while balancing full-time employment. Unfortunately, this leaves little time for self-care or managing my own wellbeing.

The hardest part of this experience has been the psychological burden and the sheer difficulty in accessing and coordinating appropriate care for her, amplified by our location in a regional area. Support structures in places like Campbelltown are not as readily available as they might be in more urban settings, and this geographical disparity significantly affects our ability to receive timely and adequate services.

I implore you to advocate for improvements in national support systems, particularly emphasising the needs of those in rural or remote locations. Supporting Violet’s national program would be a transformative step in providing essential assistance, guidance, and emotional support to families like mine who are navigating the multifaceted challenges of elder care. This program would not only make a significant difference in our lives but would resonate across many Australian families, thus improving our collective capacity to care for our aging population effectively.

My name is Sheron Bleasdale, and I am currently the full-time caregiver for my 77-year-old mother, Mary Mallia, who resides with me in Macquarie Links. My life has recently transformed significantly as I’ve assumed full responsibility for my mother's care. Balancing this role with part-time Saturday work—necessary to support my family financially—has been incredibly challenging, especially since I had to relinquish my full-time employment.

The financial strain of caregiving on a single income has impacted our quality of life deeply. The simple pleasures of dining out or taking family vacations have become unaffordable luxuries. Family dynamics further complicate my situation because my mother is not in control of her finances, and her husband, holding power of attorney, offers no monetary support for her care. This arrangement forces me to juggle resources constantly, adding stress to our family life.

Support in managing these complex family dynamics and additional financial aid would profoundly change our situation. I believe that many caregivers nationwide, particularly those in the 'Sandwich Generation' caring for both children and elderly parents, share these challenges.

Therefore, I urge you and your colleagues to advocate for enhanced caregiver support on a national level. Supporting initiatives like Violet’s national program could provide essential guidance and support, alleviating the burden on families like mine and ensuring our elderly are cared for with dignity.

Your support could be transformative, ensuring a more sustainable caregiving environment for countless Australians.

Since the passing of my adoptive mum, I have been the primary carer for Silvio, who lives independently and speaks limited English. My responsibilities also stretch to raising three young children and upholding my work commitments.

The physical distance and financial constraints restrict my ability to visit him to once a week and support him daily via phone and email. Each day brings a worry that he might suffer another fall, and without immediate family nearby, these concerns are magnified.

The emotional and logistical toll of coordinating his care from a distance, especially as he requires an interpreter for health care communications, is overwhelming. The process of waiting for an ACAT assessment has been particularly strenuous.

Immediate and tailored support to navigate the complexities of the health, aged care, and home care systems would be extraordinarily beneficial. Improved resources and services, particularly for those of us in the 'Sandwich Generation' who care for elderly parents while raising a family, are necessary to ensure we do not falter under the growing demands.

I'm currently the full-time caregiver for my 77-year-old mother, Mary Mallia, who now depends on me entirely. Over the past few years, I've had to shift from not only being her daughter but to thinking and doing everything for her as she can no longer manage on her own.

This role change has significantly affected my ability to work, thereby stripping me of any personal income. Supporting both my children and mother without a steady income has been incredibly challenging. The lack of financial stability, the intense family dynamics, and the emotional toll of caregiving are aspects of my life that have become everyday struggles.

Like many Australians in similar situations, finding a balance is becoming increasingly unattainable. It is vital that we acknowledge and address the unique challenges faced by full-time caregivers. Support in managing intricate family dynamics and the stress it encompasses would provide immense relief and aid effective caregiving.

Over the past few years, my role has shifted from managing mum's affairs to full-time care, a change that has brought profound stress and a drastic reshaping of my personal life.

Each week, I dedicate more than ten hours to mum's care, often sacrificing the quality time I could have spent with my husband. The time and emotion involved in navigating the healthcare system, managing Centrelink and medical paperwork, and attending countless appointments have been overwhelming. The journey to obtain an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) approval alone took over a year.

The complexities of caring for mum are compounded by her living in Leumeah, which poses additional challenges in accessing timely and specialised services for her dementia. As her condition worsens, it becomes increasingly clear that transitioning her to a nursing home is necessary for her wellbeing.

It is not just our family navigating this exhausting path; countless Australians face similar trials every day.

This program could significantly aid in planning for end-of-life stages, help alleviate family tensions, and better navigate our health and aged care services.

My name is Deirdre Royer, and I am currently the primary caregiver for my 91-year-old mother, Muriel, in our home in postcode 2560. As her health declines, the emotional and practical challenges of caregiving intensify. The shift from working full-time to becoming a full-time carer has not only altered my lifestyle but has left me grappling with the inevitable progression of her age-related needs.

The hardest part, unequivocally, is the knowledge that my mother's condition will only deteriorate. Daily, I manage her care, juggling medical appointments, and personal needs, all while attempting to maintain some semblance of personal well-being. This constant concern for the future—how to navigate the labyrinth of health services and aged care, and how her needs will evolve—is incredibly taxing.

In rural and regional areas like ours, accessing specialised health and aged care resources is a significant hurdle. The limited availability of services complicates an already demanding situation, leading to delays and additional stress. Support in efficiently navigating these services would greatly alleviate our burden, allowing better focus on quality life for both my mother and me.

Thus, I urge you to advocate for expanded support and funding for Violet’s national program. This initiative would greatly assist caregivers like myself in accessing necessary resources, providing emotional support, and offering practical guidance through the complexities of aged and health care services.

I'm also in the challenging position of caring for my 81-year-old mother, Judy, who lives 2 hours away in a rural area. Mum is becoming less mobile and increasingly stubborn about accepting help, which makes my responsibility even more difficult.

Every month, I travel to her, doing all the chores from washing and shopping to cooking, with hardly any support or downtime for myself. The juggling act between working in the city, managing a home, and ensuring Mum's needs are met is daunting. It is not just the physical distance that's challenging but also the emotional toll of trying to facilitate care when she is resistant and family dynamics complicate matters further.

This experience is exhausting and I'm often left feeling helpless, especially with the lack of available resources and knowledge about them. What would make a significant difference is having access to a support system that addresses these very specific needs—help managing family dynamics during these stressful times and assistance in caring for elderly loved ones who resist help.

Over the past few years, my role in my parent's life has evolved significantly, pivoting towards learning how to handle complex care responsibilities with limited support and resources.

The most challenging aspect of this journey has been the deficiency in my knowledge about effectively managing the increasing needs of aging care. There are countless times I've found myself uncertain and unprepared to make critical decisions concerning my parent's health and well-being.

Currently, the support systems seem sparse, especially in getting clear, understandable information that can assist non-professional caregivers like myself to feel more confident and competent in their roles.

I am urging you, alongside other members of the government, to support the initiative for a national program, perhaps something akin to Violet's model, which supports caregivers across Australia. Such a program would provide not only the practical guidance needed but also the emotional support and resources to navigate aged care services efficiently.

My mother suffers from undiagnosed dementia and blindness and has a history of frequent, severe falls.

Despite being financially capable, she refuses paid care or moving into a nursing facility, pushing the caregiving responsibilities onto me. This situation has led to significant emotional and physical tolls, including my health crisis with pneumonia and a collapsed lung and my son's severe pneumonia, undiagnosed until critical.

It's impossible to balance the demanding needs of my children and my mother, my health, and the challenges I face daily. The pressure is compounded by unresolvable family dynamics, where the needs and complexities of caregiving are not fully appreciated or supported by other family members.

This responsibility is layered atop my role as a mother to an eight-year-old with learning difficulties, stretching my capacities thin on good days and overwhelming me on others.

My name is Annie Cronyn from St Kilda, and I am currently caring for my 87-year-old father, Ron, who has recently moved into aged care. As his daughter, it's deeply challenging to see him vulnerable and know there is little I can do to reverse the effects of age. Our daily interactions, although precious, are often strained by communication barriers that leave me feeling helpless and guilty.

The emotional toll of watching my father grow increasingly dependent, coupled with the logistical demands of frequent visits and calls, significantly impacts my wellbeing. The constant concern for his health and care quality, along with managing my own life, is a relentless balancing act.

The experience of caring for an ageing parent in a facility, away from the direct oversight of family, brings unique challenges. Regular communication and visits become crucial, yet the barriers of distance and time make these interactions both vital and exhausting.

I am asking for your support in advocating for a national caregiver support initiative, similar to Violet’s proposed program. This initiative is crucial not just for my situation but for many Australians in similar circumstances. Such a program would offer practical guidance, emotional support, and resources to navigate the complexities of aged care more effectively.

Enhanced support for caregivers would not only improve the quality of life for the elderly, like my father, but also for those who care for them, reducing stress and enabling better care outcomes.

Thank you for considering this significant matter.

Warm regards,

My name is Denise Dsylva, and I am currently navigating the profoundly emotional journey of caring for my mother, Yvonne, during her declining years. Every weekend and public holiday, I step into the role that nobody anticipates - from daughter to primary carer.

Living in Albert Park, I am keenly aware of the difficulties faced by many in our community who are balancing caregiving with other profound life demands. Observing my mother's decline has been the most heart-wrenching experience. The emotional toll, coupled with the challenge of planning for the inevitable, is overwhelming. 

Currently, there is limited support available that addresses the complexities involved with the later stages of life although fee recieved great advice and care from eastern Pallative health. What would be truly transformational for carers like myself is targeted support that helps with these specific drags: emotional, practical, and anticipatory planning for end-of-life stages.

Thus, I am appealing to you to champion and support the establishment of a national program, perhaps integrated into Violet’s existing framework, that offers structured support for caregivers. This program should focus on providing practical guidance, emotional support, and specialised resources for families managing end-of-life care, particularly catering to the unique challenges faced by individuals in rural and remote areas.

Please consider advocating for better support systems for caregivers nationally, as this will serve as a backbone for many Australians dealing with the complexities of an aging population. Your support could pave the way for a more compassionate approach to end-of-life care, enabling carers like myself to provide the love and dignity our loved ones deserve during their most vulnerable times.

My name is Colleen Fuller and I live in the Blue Mountains region with my 86-year-old mother, Cecilia Fanning. In recent years, Cecilia's vision has significantly declined, which has required me to take unpaid leave from work to ensure her needs are met. This time away from my job has placed a serious financial strain on both of us, making a challenging situation even more arduous.

Living in a regional area like the Blue Mountains presents unique difficulties in caring for an elderly parent. The availability of essential health services is limited, and travelling to appointments requires considerable time and expense. Additionally, the emotional toll of watching a loved one decline without adequate support is deeply distressing.

The hardest part of this experience has been the financial loss combined with a lack of appropriate support systems for caregivers in similar situations. Practical assistance in planning for the last stages of Cecilia's life would be invaluable, not just for our family, but for countless others across the country. This support would help to mitigate the pressures faced by so many, providing both guidance and relief during such a critical phase.

I urge you to advocate for increased funding and support for Violet’s national program, which aims to provide necessary guidance and resources to families like mine. Implementing this program would deliver crucial support, helping to better prepare and assist Australia’s aging population and their caregivers.

My name is Annemarie Canm from Winmalee, NSW. I am currently providing care for my elderly parents, David and Lis, aged 65 and 64 respectively. Over the past few years, my role in their lives has evolved significantly as they've grown to need more assistance in everyday activities. This has been a challenging transition for us all, particularly as my parents struggle to accept their increasing frailty and dependency.

One of the greatest challenges we face is communication. My parents often resist conversations about their needs and future care, which makes planning and support incredibly difficult. The emotional toll on our family is significant, and there are days when the responsibility feels overwhelming. It impacts not just our emotional well-being but also our ability to lead balanced lives.

I am writing to urge your support for initiatives like Violet’s national program. A resource that helps families navigate these crucial conversations, understand the options available, and manage the responsibilities of caregiving would be invaluable. We desperately need more structured support systems, educational resources, and services that can sustain both the physical and emotional well-being of caregivers and their aging family members.

Please advocate for better caregiver support nationally to aid Australians like myself who are dedicated to caring for our elderly parents. As our population ages, the need for compassionate, effective care solutions becomes more urgent.

Thank you for your attention to this vital issue.

My name is Cp from Penrith, postcode 2750. I am currently the secondary carer for my 75-year-old parent, Harry, while also managing the demands of raising a one-year-old child. Harry, who now lives with us, requires constant attention and medical care, which is incredibly challenging to balance with the needs of a growing baby.

The difficulty of simultaneously caring for an elderly parent and a young child cannot be overstated. Each day brings a series of medical appointments and family obligations that stretch my time and emotional capacity to their limits. Managing such diverse needs, from paediatric visits to geriatric care, puts considerable strain on our family dynamics. It often leads to stressed interactions and disagreements among family members, further complicating an already strenuous situation.

The challenges faced by those of us in this 'Sandwich Generation', caring for both aging parents and young children, are profound. We are pulled in multiple directions, trying to meet the diverse needs of our loved ones. Support in managing family dynamics and reducing stress would be invaluable to us.

Therefore, I strongly advocate for your support for Violet's national program. This initiative is crucial as it aims to provide the necessary guidance, emotional support, and resources to families like mine across Australia. As our population ages, it is imperative that comprehensive support systems are in place to aid caregivers in balancing their responsibilities effectively.

My name is Jo Di Pietro, a resident of Wentworth Falls, postcode 2782. I am writing to share my experience and seek your support as I navigate the challenges of caring for my 98-year-old mother. She lives with me and requires constant care, which has forced me to work part-time and has significant financial implications due to the structure of aged care funding.

Caring for my mother, who suffers from separation anxiety, means arranging care during work hours and attending to her throughout the night when she is restless. This affects my health — having battled breast cancer and recently faced a thyroid cancer scare, the stress and exhaustion is relentless. The reality is that 40% of her Level 4 package is consumed by fees and travel, leaving insufficient funds for the care she truly needs.

The hardest part is feeling utterly alone in this journey. My mother's dependence on me has caused me to lose significant parts of my own life and interests, and other family members are unable to share this burden. The support that would make a marked difference for us includes improved navigation through health, aged care, and home care services.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced support systems tailored for caregivers like myself across Australia, especially as our population ages. Your support for initiatives such as Violet’s national program would help provide the practical guidance and emotional support desperately needed by so many.

This is not just my plea, but a call to recognise and act on behalf of the 'Sandwich Generation' who balance caring for elderly parents with other life responsibilities. Your action can significantly improve our ability to care for our loved ones without losing ourselves in the process.

Both my life and their care needs have changed drastically over the past few years, especially as one of my parents has developed dementia. Each day involves shopping, managing doctor appointments, and coordinating their care within a nursing home, all while balancing my own work and family life.

The struggle lies in navigating the complexities of health, aged care, and home care services, with only finite resources at my disposal. The emotional and physical toll this takes while trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy for my own family is overwhelming.

As Australia’s population ages, I am not alone in this journey—many like me face these `sandwich generation` challenges, particularly heightened in regions like ours where resources are even more stretched. Guided support for navigating systems and proactive care strategies would make a profound difference.

I respectfully urge you to champion and support policies and funding for national programs, such as Violet's initiative, aimed at bolstering resources and guidance for caregivers across our nation. By advocating for such support, we can ensure caregivers are equipped to manage their dual roles effectively, reducing emotional strain and promoting a healthier work-life balance.

This journey has involved managing all his daily needs, from feeding and cleaning to attending medical appointments—tasks complicated by my lack of transportation and without any external support.

Living in the 5096 area, our access to adequate caregiving resources is limited, creating not only physical but emotional toil as well. The strain of continuous care without respite or support intensifies family dynamics, especially when there is disagreement or stress among relatives.

Millions of Australians are concurrently navigating the complexities of caregiving and personal responsibilities. My experience reflects a broader national issue that needs immediate attention: the support for caregivers, particularly those in regional, rural, or remote areas.

Such support would not only improve the quality of life for caregivers and those they look after but also alleviate the emotional and logistical burdens that presently weigh heavily on us.

My name is Judith Hassall, and I am writing to share the profound challenges I face as a full-time caregiver for my 85-year-old mother, Ann, who is braving the complexities of dementia and increasing frailty. This role demands at least six to eight hours of dedicated care daily, along with constant emotional and logistical support, significantly impacting my personal and financial wellbeing as a single woman.

The most heart-wrenching aspect of my caregiving journey is witnessing my mother's gradual loss of self - a fear that looms over me about my future too. Additionally, this commitment has caused the disintegration of my social connections and has placed me in isolation, heightening my emotional strain.

The rising cost of living adds another layer of complexity. Even though we live in a metropolitan area there is still at times limited access to specialised healthcare and support services, which amplifies our challenges. The cost of resources and professional support means the responsibility falls heavily on my shoulders, with little respite or assistance.

A national support program, such as the proposed funding for Violet's initiative, would be invaluable not only to me but also to countless others in similar situations across Australia. Such a program would provide essential guidance, support, and the tools necessary for managing the demands of caregiving. 

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support the establishment of better support systems for caregivers nationally.

My name is Sheree Laursen, and I reside in the regional suburb of postcode 3551, caring for my 83-year-old father, Ian. In recent years, my role as Ian's primary caregiver has expanded significantly. This escalation involves travelling frequently, tightly managing both our schedules, and overseeing aspects of his life from healthcare to household maintenance.

The breadth of responsibilities is exhausting, particularly as they compound on my own life’s demands. The most gruelling aspect is undoubtedly the time management and travel, constantly balancing between my father's increasing needs and my personal and professional commitments. The emotional toll is palpable, and navigating the complex aged care system adds another layer of stress.

What would markedly lessen this burden is streamlined access to services oriented towards the unique challenges faced by caregivers in rural and remote areas like ours. Support in efficiently managing health, aged care, and home care services would not only alleviate the physical and mental strain on caregivers but could drastically improve the quality of life for our elderly loved ones.

Therefore, I urgently request your support for increased funding and resources for Violet’s national program. This program promises to offer crucial guidance and support, helping caregivers navigate the complexities of aged care. Its implementation can profoundly impact many Australians, offering relief and necessary aid as our population continues to age.

Until recently, I cared for my dear husband in his final days, a role that brought to light significant challenges within our healthcare and aged care sectors, particularly in transparency and respect for patient and caregiver voices.

In the last and most critical days of my husband's life, despite holding the power of attorney for his health, my input and his wishes were dismissed, leading to decisions that neither he nor I wanted.

My name is Di Scott, and I am writing to you from my home in postcode 5114, where I dedicate much of my time to caring for my 90-year-old mother, Jeanette Scott. Following the recent passing of my father, her husband of 67 years, my responsibilities have drastically increased. Daily, I manage Jeanette's significant needs, from organising my late father’s affairs and ensuring her well-being through daily phone calls and visits.

This role, while full of love and devotion, strains my work-life balance immensely. As I approach the end of my career, I have exhausted much of my sick leave to provide necessary care. Most challenging has been witnessing their struggle with the fast-paced digital world. Entities often overlook that many from Jeanette's generation cannot engage with online systems, causing them significant distress and dependency.

And herein lies a broader societal issue that we, as a nation, must address. The elderly, who have contributed so much to our communities, deserve to age with dignity and adequate support. Yet, they, along with their caregivers, often feel helpless and overlooked.

I implore you to advocate for enhanced support systems for elderly Australians and their caregivers, specifically through national programmes like Violet’s. Such initiatives are crucial for providing practical assistance and ensuring that no elderly citizen or their caregiver must navigate this challenging journey alone.

Thank you for your attention and for considering this significant matter that affects many Australian families.

Yours sincerely,

My name is Tricia Anne, and I am a primary caregiver for my 75-year-old mother, Bev, who struggles with chronic illnesses. Alongside my two adult sons, we devote three days each week to her care, taking on roles from driving to cleaning to managing her healthcare.

Watching my mother's health decline has been profoundly distressing, compounded by a glaring lack of medical and community support in our area. Services that could greatly ease our burden are overwhelmed, leaving us to face these challenges with scant assistance.

The emotional and physical toll of caregiving is relentless, but the hardest part is feeling forgotten by a system unequipped to handle the growing needs of our aging population, particularly in less urban areas like ours in postcode 5114. It’s clear that the existing infrastructure is insufficient to support not only my mother but countless others in similar situations across our nation.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for substantial support for Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to deliver not only practical guidance and emotional support but also to enhance access to aged care services that can profoundly impact the quality of life for families like mine. 

This is not just an investment in the well-being of our elderly but a necessary step towards supporting the ""Sandwich Generation"" who find themselves caught between caregiving and other life responsibilities. The future security and dignity of our elderly population depend on action taken today.

Thank you for considering this urgent plea for support, for the sake of all Australian families navigating these complex challenges.

My name is Tricia Anne, and I reside in the 5114 postcode area. Currently, I am the primary caregiver for my 75-year-old mother, Bev, who is grappling with chronic illnesses. Over the recent years, my role has evolved significantly, now encompassing acting as her advocate, driver, cleaner, and caregiver. 

Each week, my two adult sons and I dedicate three days to assist her, a commitment that reflects both love and necessity. Despite our collective efforts, the hardest part of this journey is witnessing her health decline amidst a backdrop of inadequate community and medical support. Our local services are overwhelmed, and the scarcity in support exacerbates the challenges we face daily.

The physical and emotional toll, coupled with a lack of external assistance, raises concern for both my mother’s well-being and our ability to sustain this level of care. Enhanced support services for caregivers in rural and regional areas like ours would significantly improve our capacity to manage these responsibilities while maintaining our health and livelihood.

Thus, I urge you to advocate for increased funding and support for the Sandwich Generation, those of us caught between caring for our aging parents and managing other familial responsibilities. Specifically, endorsing programs like Violet’s national initiative could provide crucial guidance, emotional backing, and aid in navigating aged care services that are currently stretched beyond their limits.

By fortifying caregiver support, we can ensure that more Australians do not have to face these challenges alone. Your support could dramatically alter the landscape of aged care and caregiver assistance across the nation.

My name is Donna Louise, and I currently reside in the suburb of Gisborne, postcode 3437. I write to share the demands and challenges of caring for my 87-year-old father, an experience that encapsulates my daily reality. My role as his carer alongside being a mother and wife requires a delicate balance, which has proven to be incredibly strenuous.

Each day, I dedicate over 20 hours weekly to ensure my father’s needs are met, managing this alongside my family obligations. This situation often leaves me stretched thin, trying to meet the emotional and physical needs of everyone in my life. The immense pressure to maintain these dual roles impacts not just my well-being, but also that of my family.

Living in a regional area adds a layer of complexity to accessing adequate resources and support, which could ease some of our burdens. The availability of a program that supports caregivers like myself would be invaluable. Specifically, assistance in navigating important conversations about care options and future planning would significantly alleviate the stress we face.

Thus, I urge you to consider advocating for increased support for caregivers nationally and to back funding for initiatives such as Violet's national program. Such support would not only aid in enhancing the quality of life for our elderly but also provide necessary resources to their caregivers who juggle multiple significant responsibilities.

Your support in these matters is crucial for not only addressing the needs of families like mine but improving the caregiving landscape across Australia.

My name is Lisa Weier from Woodend, postcode 3437. I am currently navigating the complexities of caring for my 84-year-old father, Ross. This journey is immensely challenging not least due to his strong personality, which has intensified with age, making it difficult to aid him as he becomes less receptive to help.

Managing his needs with a home care package, I confront daily the struggles of balancing this responsibility with my own life and the broader family dynamics. The tension escalates when family opinions on his care diverge, adding emotional stress and hindering effective collaboration. This situation profoundly impacts our mental well-being and family unity.

The hardest part of this experience is not just the physical care but also the emotional labour of respecting his autonomy while ensuring his safety and health. As the Australian population ages, and more people find themselves in similar circumstances, it is imperative to acknowledge and support the 'Sandwich Generation', who shoulder the dual burden of caring for elderly parents and managing their own lives.

There is a vital need for comprehensive support programs that address not only the logistical aspects of caregiving but also the emotional and psychological well-being of carers. To this end, I strongly advocate for your support for Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to provide crucial guidance and assistance, helping families across Australia to navigate these testing times with greater ease and support.

Your action can genuinely transform the lives of many Australians facing these familial responsibilities. Please consider advocating for improved caregiver support on a national scale.

My name is Sarah Jones, residing in the suburb of 3089. I am writing to you as the primary caregiver for my elderly parents, Margaret and David, aged 80 and 82 respectively. Over the past few years, their health has progressively declined, necessitating increased support with housing, healthcare follow-ups, and daily routines due to significant memory loss and severe mood fluctuations. This situation is compounded by their denial of these health issues, creating a challenging caregiving environment for my siblings and me.

We collectively dedicate between 5 to 20 hours weekly to assist our parents. This commitment, while done out of love and necessity, places considerable strain on our own lives, including our work and mental health due to their non-engagement. The emotional toll and time commitment are substantial, as managing severe mood swings and denial of medical conditions are particularly draining.

Support in planning for the later stages of their lives would be deeply beneficial. Enhanced resources and programs tailored towards families like mine, grappling with the complexities of elderly care, would provide immense relief and guidance.

I urge you to consider advocating for improved support systems for caregivers nationally, especially for those dealing with dementia and similar conditions. Funding for programs like Violet’s national program can offer critical resources, emotional support, and practical assistance to families across Australia facing these heart-wrenching challenges.

Enhanced caregiver support is not just a personal relief but a national necessity as our population ages. Your action on this matter would be instrumental in aiding countless families during these trying times.

My name is Wendy James, and I live in the suburb of Varsity Lakes, QLD 4227. As an individual deeply entrenched in the care of my ageing parents with no financial aid such as the carer's payment, and simultaneously raising my children, it is evident that our situation encapsulates the challenges many Australian families face daily. This dual responsibility magnifies the physical, financial, and emotional demands placed upon what is often referred to as the 'Sandwich Generation'.

Each day, I am confronted with the complexities of managing family dynamics, particularly as tensions heighten and disagreements occur, all while ensuring the wellbeing of both my children and parents. Sadly, these stressors have intensified over the recent years, making the balancing act even more precarious.

Specific supports that would make a significant difference to us include access to guidance on managing family dynamics under stress and navigating the aged care system effectively.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for increased support and resources, including the funding of national programs like Violet’s, which promises to provide practical guidance, emotional support, and tailored assistance to families like mine facing the rigours of caregiving. It is crucial, now more than ever, to establish robust support systems catered to our rapidly ageing population across all regions of Australia.

My name is Jadie Hyman, residing in the 4226 area, and I am reaching out to you on behalf of a silent but significant group in our community. I care for my elderly parents, aged 94 and 92, who are in an aged care facility. Despite having professional care, they depend heavily on my daily visits and support to manage their day-to-day lives and health complications. This ongoing role is not only demanding but profoundly impacts my emotional well-being and personal life.

Observing my parents' health deteriorate and having to prioritise their emergencies over personal or professional commitments has been my life's most challenging journey. Furthermore, our situation echoes a common narrative across our nation, particularly highlighting the struggles faced by individuals caring for loved ones in aged care facilities. Providing continuous care under these circumstances is a responsibility that involves significant emotional and physical sacrifice.

Given these challenges, I urge you to support and advocate for a national initiative like Violet's program, which aims to offer essential support to caregivers. Such a program would significantly relieve the stress of people like myself, who juggle the care of aging parents with other life responsibilities. It could assist us in planning and managing the end-of-life care stages, which is an unavoidable and arduous part of our roles.

The commitment of your office can bring about meaningful change and provide much-needed support and resources to enhance the quality of life for both aged citizens and their caregivers.

Over the past few years, my father's condition has deteriorated such that he requires constant supervision and assistance, a condition that proves difficult as I provide for all of my family's needs—from meals, shopping, and home maintenance to financial management and social support. This is a demanding juggling act, further complicated by exceptional challenges including sudden needs from my father at all hours, even at the cost of my own rest.

Our situation is not unique. Across Australia, many are in the 'Sandwich Generation', simultaneously providing care to aging parents and their own children. Moreover, residing in a rural area like Currumbin Valley brings additional challenges, including limited access to support services and expert care. These circumstances significantly affect our family dynamics, which at times can become stressed and fractured.

I am urgently asking for your support for initiatives like Violet's national programme, which promises to be a beacon of hope. This programme not only equips families but also provides vital assistance in managing the intricacies of care, including navigating aged care services and providing psychological support.

Each day, I spend numerous hours handling a variety of needs, from managing Angus’s complex care plans to making emergency trips across states to support my mother. With my children’s needs and my mum’s health declining, I’ve had to step back from potential senior executive roles, dramatically altering our family's financial and emotional landscape.

Navigating services like the NDIS and Centrelink adds monumental stress. The processes are outdated and the transition to new systems painfully slow, compounding the day-to-day challenges we face.

Over the past few years, my role has evolved to encompass a wide range of responsibilities, from attending medical appointments to financial management and coordinating in-home support.

Each week, I dedicate approximately 14-20 hours to my parents’ care. Despite this commitment, navigating the complexities of government services like My Aged Care and securing competent support workers remains a formidable challenge. I have ceased my professional work to focus on their care, a decision that unfortunately renders me ineligible for a carer's payment or allowance. Compounding these struggles, I also juggle my responsibilities towards my four adult children and three grandchildren, often feeling guilty for the time my caring duties subtract from them.

The responsibility is both physically and emotionally draining, and the journey has been fraught with difficult conversations and stressful family disagreements.

Caring in such a capacity is a relentless task compounded by the emotional toll of managing conflicting opinions and expectations among family members.

Living in postcode 3106, my experience reflects not just personal hardship but a broader issue affecting families nationwide.

Alzheimer's has turned our lives into a cycle of constant medical appointments, tireless advocacy, and very little personal time. Despite being financially more prepared than most, the reality is that existing support often falls short of what is vitally needed. Simple services like shopping and cleaning are funded, yet these barely scratch the surface of requirements for someone with dementia, particularly when erratic behaviours such as wandering are everyday risks.

My name is Jae, and I write to you from the heart of my home in postcode 3825, where I am deeply entrenched in the role of primary caregiver to my 83-year-old father, Ted, and my 63-year-old brother, Rod. As the years have progressed, they have required increasing support, which has led me to step back from my professional life, impacting my ability to provide for my own needs and those of my husband.

The weight of caregiving is substantial, sharing my time between my father and brother, while also attempting to meet the needs of another brother who benefits from the NDIS. Balancing these responsibilities has left me with little time for self-care, stretching my emotional and physical capabilities to their limits. The hardest part of this journey has been managing my time and the absence of sufficient support systems, particularly in navigating the complex maze of health, aged care, and home care services.

This situation is not unique to me but is a lived reality for many Australians, particularly in rural and regional areas like ours, where services can be less accessible. The necessity for a structured support system becomes even more vital in such contexts.

I urge you to advocate and support the development and funding of Violet’s national program. This initiative would immensely aid individuals like myself by providing essential guidance and support, facilitating easier navigation through our health and aged care systems.

Recognising the challenges faced by caregivers nationwide will ensure better quality life for our aging population and relieve the emotional and physical toll on families like mine.

My name is Liz Kelly, and I reach out to you today not only as a devoted daughter but also as a vivid representation of a growing group in our community—the 'Sandwich Generation.' I care for my 82-year-old mother, Maureen, who recently had to relocate closer to Melbourne due to the scarcity of mental health services in rural areas. This transition was necessary to ensure she receives the adequate psychiatric support that wasn't available in her previous rural setting, even though it means frequent 1.5-hour travels for me whenever she faces mental crises.

The crux of our challenges lies in the dire lack of localised support for mental health in rural locales. Had these services been available nearer to her previous home, this upheaval might have been avoided, sparing her the stress of displacement and me the constant worry and logistic strain. 

The emotional and time investments in caregiving, alongside my responsibilities to my own family, underscore the need for robust national strategies to aid caregivers. The establishment of comprehensive support frameworks, especially tailored for mental health and end-of-life planning in rural regions, is well overdue. These services would immensely enhance the quality of life for my mother and offer much-needed relief and support to caregivers like myself.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced caregiver support through initiatives like Violet’s national program. Such an endeavour is critical not only for our aging population but also for their dedicated caregivers, ensuring they have the necessary resources at their disposal.

I am Adele Rose, a resident of 4217, writing to you as a caregiver for my uncle Joseph, age 72, who now requires profound support due to a decline in his health. As he grapples with increased medical issues, his inability to drive or work anymore has placed him in a position where he heavily relies on my assistance.

The most challenging aspect of caregiving has been observing Joseph's health deteriorate while struggling to be proactive about his needs, including organising life administrative tasks that he can no longer manage. The emotional toll of watching someone I deeply care for decline without knowing the best steps to take is immense.

Living in a regional area poses additional barriers, including limited access to specialised healthcare services and a lack of tailored support for caregivers. This situation not only impacts Joseph's quality of life but also places significant stress on me as I navigate these uncharted waters virtually alone.

What would truly make a difference for us is a structured support system that aids in planning for the last stages of life, ensuring that caregivers like myself are not left feeling helpless and overwhelmed. Therefore, I urge you to support the funding for Violet's national program. This initiative promises to offer practical guidance and emotional support, thereby enhancing the capability of caregivers to manage the intricacies of caring for the elderly.

Supporting this program will not only aid my uncle and myself but also countless others in our community, ensuring that as our population ages, they do so with dignity and substantial support.

My name is Kat Lardner, and I am reaching out from the heart of our community in postcode 4217, as a devoted daughter, mother, and full-time employee. Over the recent years, my role has significantly shifted as I have become the primary caregiver for my elderly parents. This role intertwines with rearing my children and managing a full-time career, weaving a complex tapestry of responsibilities that leaves little room for respite.

Navigating the daily logistics of doctor's appointments, meal times, and shopping trips with my parents while balancing work and my children's needs is an enormous challenge. This juggling act is compounded by the familial stress that arises when expectations clash and support is scant. These circumstances speak to a broader, critical issue faced by many Australians, often referred to as the 'Sandwich Generation,' who care for their aging parents whilst supporting their own children.

The strain of constant caregiving without adequate support systems profoundly impacts our emotional well-being and ability to function across all aspects of life. In rural and regional areas like ours, the challenge is even more pronounced due to limited access to services and resources.

Thus, I urge you to advocate for stronger national support mechanisms, specifically through backing initiatives like Violet's national program. This program promises not just to alleviate the practical burdens of caregiving but also to offer crucial guidance in managing family dynamics during such tender phases of life.

My role spans from personal caregiving to navigating an often-bewildering landscape of health and aged care services. Our household feels the strain, as I strive to provide the necessary support for my mother while ensuring my children and spouse do not feel neglected.

My name is Jodie Moss, and I live in the suburb of Hillarys, postcode 6025. I care for my children, aged 18, 16, and 12, all of whom are autistic and have genetic chronic health disorders. In recent years, I provided care for my in-laws and my mother, who have faced severe health challenges from dementia, cancer, and strokes.

I dedicate my days to caring for my mother, Marcelle, who is bravely living with dementia. As her condition deteriorates, her needs intensify, requiring my constant attention and significantly affecting my own wellbeing.

Living in the suburb of Connolly, WA, I experience firsthand the complexities of navigating health, aged care, and home care services, especially in less urbanised regions. The emotional and physical demand of caregiving, coupled with the challenge of accessing specialised services in our area, is overwhelming.

Her health has deteriorated rapidly, and I've had to take leave from my full-time job, unsure of how I’ll manage when she is discharged with significant disabilities. Additionally, her partner has found himself unable to cope, placing further emotional and practical burdens on my shoulders.

The hardest part of this journey is the constant worry about the future—how to support her increased care needs without the necessary resources or information.

I live in a suburban area, postcode 4111, tending to my 85-year-old mother who, over the past seven years, has increasingly relied on my support due to her declining ability to look after herself.

Each day, I manage her medications, health appointments, and meals, while also overseeing the upkeep of her home, which she is not ready to sell. Amidst these responsibilities, I am stretched thin, maintaining a part-time job and taking care of my young children aged 10 and 6.

My name is Kerri Strong, and I recently moved from Victoria to Queensland to care for my aging parents, Pat and Owen. My father suffered a transient ischemic attack, and my mother has begun showing signs of dementia, creating a situation where neither could manage alone. I also provide support to my aunt who has no other family members of my generation and who needa significant support to navigate services as she cannot use the internet or a mobile phone. My decision meant leaving my children back in Victoria, which has been tremendously challenging both emotionally and logistically.

Being a caregiver while managing my own needs as an individual with ASD and ADHD presents unique challenges. My mother, Pat, is particularly resistant to receiving help, complicating the caregiving process and adding stress to our family dynamic. This resistance makes daily life not only difficult for her but for me as I try to ensure her safety and quality of life.

Support services like having critical conversations, navigating health, aged care, and home care services are crucial for someone in my situation. Integration of care to look after the whole family unit would also be wonderful. If my NDIS and my parents aged care funding could be pooled so we can access caregivers who can meet our collective needs would alleviate significant stress and allow me to provide better care for my parents while managing family dynamics, especially during high-stress periods. The number of external organisations we need to navigate can be overwhelming and is needlessly complex.

I urge your strong advocacy for increased funds and support towards national programs designed to assist caregivers, including strong advocacy to maintain flexible working conditions. I have 16 years of working life left until retirement age, but am highly concerned that Peter Duttons push to stop working from home arrangements for public servants like myself will mean that I would be unable to support my parents and continue to work. I am currently able to work full time and accompany my parents and my aunt to appointments, as there is less travel time involved than there would be if i were in the office full time. Such support would not only help families like mine but also reduce the emotional and logistical burdens we carry daily. These programs are essential as our population ages and more Australians find themselves in caregiving roles.

As Warren's health has sharply declined, my role as his caregiver has evolved into a relentless 24/7 commitment. This change has gravely impacted not only our finances — as I've had to cease work and we survive on a meagre $50 fortnightly pension — but it has also compounded our isolation in a regional area where medical and aged care services are depressingly limited.

Our situation in Inverell exemplifies the pronounced hardships faced in rural areas, where distance and a lack of local resources magnify every challenge associated with caregiving. The emotional toll, heightened by our physical seclusion and struggle to access necessary services, is overwhelming. Moreover, with my own recent cancer diagnosis, the strain has doubled; there are days when my own health and emotional reserves have plummeted to worrying lows.

The impact of Alzheimer’s on our family cannot be overstated. Each visit is a reminder of the relentless toll this disease takes on her, and the emotional strain on me is immense. Like many in my situation, I struggle to balance these duties with other family responsibilities and my own wellbeing.

Support in navigating the complex landscape of health, aged care, and home care services would be incredibly beneficial. My role as a caregiver has evolved and so, too, should the support systems in place for people like me. We are often referred to as the 'Sandwich Generation,' caught between caring for our elderly parents and managing our other life commitments.

I urge you to advocate for increased funding and support for Violet's national program. This initiative promises to provide essential guidance and support, helping Australians like myself manage the care of our loved ones while maintaining our own health and careers. Enhanced caregiver support is crucial for our ageing population, ensuring all Australians can age with dignity.

My name is Jo Grierson, and I am writing to share my experience and seek your support on an issue that deeply affects me and countless others—caring for an elderly parent in the rural area of Collingwood Park, QLD. At 86, my mum, Jean, has dementia, a challenge that transforms simple daily routines into complex tasks. Caring for her involves managing medications, appointments, meals, and her emotional well-being, all of which has a profound impact on my life.

The hardest part of my caregiving journey is navigating the unpredictable waves of dementia, where good days are cherished and difficult days bring undeniable strain. This emotional toll affects not only my well-being but also my ability to maintain a balanced life. This role has reshaped my existence, where the boundaries between being a daughter and a caregiver blur, testing my resilience daily.

Living in a regional area compounds these challenges, with limited access to specialised healthcare services and support networks that can ease the burden of tasks like transport and emergency care. The isolation can be overwhelming, and resources that are readily available in more urban settings are scarce or non-existent here.

In coping with these difficulties, a national program like Violet’s would be invaluable, providing structured support and practical resources which are desperately needed in rural areas like ours. I urge you to advocate for enhanced caregiver support and to consider backing Violet’s national initiative, ensuring those in similar situations can access the essential services necessary to care for our loved ones effectively.

This is not just an investment in healthcare but a commitment to sustaining the family unit as the cornerstone of our community. Your support can make a profound difference in the lives of countless Australians.

My name is Lee Serone, and I am reaching out to you not just on my behalf but in the voice of many Australians who find themselves as primary caregivers to elderly loved ones. Specifically, I am the main caregiver for my 84-year-old mother-in-law, Joan Serone, who resides in a rural area with postcode 2470.

Over the past few years, my role in Joan's life has evolved significantly—I have become her primary support, managing everything from cooking and cleaning to medical appointments. Consequently, I needed to retire early to dedicate toward her care, travelling 80 km round trip several times a week. She deserves this dedication, but the truth is, the aged care help available is remarkably insufficient.

The emotional and physical toll of caregiving are compounded by logistical challenges and an overwhelming amount of paperwork with constantly shifting rules. On any given week, I am spending at least 35 hours on care, which isolates me from other family and friends, significantly impacting my mental and physical health.

Better support navigating health, aged care, and home care services would make an immense difference, not just for me but for many in similar situations across rural Australia. Access to simplified processes and additional resources are essential.

I urge you to advocate for improved caregiver support and to consider endorsing funding for initiatives such as Violet's national program. This program promises to offer practical guidance and emotional support, easing the burdens faced by caregivers like myself.

This support would not only alleviate our daily challenges but also enrich the quality of life for our elderly, honouring their significant contributions to our nation.

My name is Judy Harrison, residing in the suburb with postcode 2456, enduring the daily challenges that come with caring for my loved one who is experiencing significant memory issues. This situation has not only transformed the dynamics within our family but has also cast a shadow of frustration and emotional toll over our lives.

The most difficult aspect of this journey has been managing the unpredictable ramifications of memory loss, which often makes meaningful communication nearly impossible. The struggle to have important conversations, and the repeated efforts to reassure and re-establish forgotten bonds, heavily impacts our emotional well-being.

Living in a more isolated location exacerbates these challenges. Access to specialised support services is limited, and the pressure to provide consistent, effective care is daunting. Yet, like many, I persist out of love and necessity.

It is clear that as our population ages, the number of families facing similar adversities will only increase. I implore you and your colleagues to advocate for enhanced national support systems that acknowledge and address the unique challenges faced by caregivers in rural and regional Australia.

I am Kylie Bourne from Alstonville, writing to share the profound challenges I face as I care for my 73-year-old mother, Rhonda, who suffers from severe Alzheimer's disease. Transitioning from a daughter to her primary carer, I've ceased paid employment to provide constant care, which includes night-time assistance and constant supervision. This role consumes my life, affecting my health and my time with my children and grandchildren.

Despite a Level 4 package from My Aged Care, the limited 15 hours a week of provided care is insufficient, leaving me feeling overwhelmed and isolated. The role of caring has transformed our mother-daughter relationship immensely. The emotional toll of witnessing my mother's decline from an independent woman to one who relies heavily on others for basic needs is indescribable.

Support in managing family dynamics and enhanced caregiving aid would significantly alleviate our daily struggles. The reality is, many Australians in rural areas like mine face similar challenges, with minimal resources and support systems available.

Thus, I am compelled to request your advocacy for increased government support and resources for caregivers nationwide, particularly for comprehensive programs like Violet’s national program. Such support would be invaluable in aiding caregivers to manage their immense responsibilities while maintaining their own health and welfare.

Your action can help ensure that caregivers receive the necessary support to continue their invaluable work without sacrificing their well-being.

My name is Cassandra Eggins, a resident of postcode 2472, and I am the full-time carer for my 83-year-old mother-in-law, Marcia, who has mid-stage vascular dementia. Over the past two years, my role as her caregiver has entirely reshaped my life. I sacrificed a career with an annual income of $86,000 to receive a Centrelink payment of merely $500 a fortnight—a decision that has significantly strained our family's financial stability.

Caring for Marcia from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., managing night-time risks, and coordinating with part-time support has become my new normal. Despite these challenges, I have committed to providing palliative care at home for as long as possible and am currently studying a Diploma of Dementia through the University of Tasmania to better equip myself for this task. However, juggling caregiving and study, coupled with the loss of income and scanty respite support, has notably diminished my quality of life. 

Amid these personal sacrifices, my biggest concern remains the last stages of Marcia's life and ensuring we have the necessary plans and support in place. It is for this reason that I urge your active support for policies that improve end-of-life care planning and financial assistance for family caregivers. I also advocate for backing Violet’s national program which aims to support caregivers like myself navigate these trying times more effectively and with greater support.

My name is Darlene Herbert, and I write to you from Dubbo, postcode 2830, as both a professional aged care manager and a daughter striving to care for her elderly parents. Managing multiple aged care packages, I witness daily the extensive delays – often exceeding a year – in assigning these crucial supports. With upcoming changes in the support system that will increasingly levy costs on pensioners, I am deeply concerned for the future of our elderly community, including my own parents.

Every Sunday, I dedicate three hours to my parents, ensuring they enjoy a social visit, while also managing their household maintenance needs. However, the systemic inefficiencies and personal exhaustion from navigating these challenges mean my parents often receive less from me than they, or I, would hope. This not only impacts my capability in professional and personal roles but leaves me with a profound sense of guilt and helplessness.

The emotional and physical toll is significant, making it clear that caregivers nationwide require better navigational tools and support structures to manage health, aged care, and home care services effectively. It is imperative to acknowledge and support the ‘Sandwich Generation’ who care for both aging parents and their own families, particularly in regional areas like mine where resources are even more strained.

I urge you to support and advocate for the funding of national programmes such as Violet’s, designed to offer practical and emotional assistance and guidance in accessing aged care services. This support is vital for enhancing the quality of life for our elderly and their caregivers across Australia.

My name is Nicoel Holmes, and I am writing from Dubbo, postcode 2830, where I reside with my 82-year-old mother. Following the loss of her husband and her own deteriorating health due to dementia and glaucoma, my mother moved in with my family. We now face the daily challenges of providing care while juggling full-time jobs and maintaining a household.

Since accommodating my mother, my husband and I have been working shifts to meet her care needs. Despite the assistance we receive from a carer for six hours weekly, my mother requires constant supervision and help, leaving us exhausted and financially stretched. The current home care package provides minimal relief, and I am contemplating leaving my job to provide full-time care, which only heightens our financial strain.

The bureaucratic barriers and complexities of accessing support through Centrelink only add to our stress. Simplifying this process and increasing the financial aid for carers could relieve a considerable burden on families like ours.

Living in a regional area compounds these challenges, with fewer resources readily available for elderly care compared to major cities. As Australia's population ages, I believe we need a comprehensive national strategy to support the 'Sandwich Generation' who are caught between raising their own families and caring for elderly parents.

The experience, though filled with love and dedication, was profoundly challenging. Observing her final moments took a significant emotional toll on me. The relentless schedule of feeding, administering medication, and providing emotional support amidst personal grief was immensely difficult.

The reality of my situation involves dedicating over 40 hours a week to my mother’s care—time that significantly impacts my ability to maintain a balanced life.

My name is Jose Crame from Dundas, and I recently faced one of life’s most heartbreaking journeys: caring for my beloved wife, Shannon, until she passed away two months ago. For years, I dedicated 28-42 hours each week to assist Shannon with her daily needs, including feeding, medication, and constant support, impacting not only my finances but also my physical health significantly.

The hardest part of this experience was undoubtedly watching Shannon decline and ultimately pass away. The emotional toll of caregiving is immense, and often, carers like myself are left to manage these burdens with inadequate support.

Throughout this challenging period, I've realised that there are severe gaps in our system, particularly concerning the recognition and assistance for those dealing with end-of-life care. Support in navigating these aspects is crucial, not just for the caregivers but for the dignity of those we care for.

My name is Jin Young Kim, residing in Dundas, and though I do not yet face the day-to-day demands of elderly care, the future holds this inevitability for many, including myself.

Our demographic landscape is aging, and with it, the responsibilities falling on individuals like myself are increasing. Without proper resources or plans, the task is daunting and foreboding.

Balancing this responsibility alongside personal and professional commitments has proven to be increasingly challenging, especially as their need for physical and emotional support grows.

Each week, I dedicate roughly ten hours to ensure my parents receive the care they deserve. This involves managing their health needs and providing the in-person support they prefer, as they find digital platforms rather impersonal and confusing. The challenge intensifies given our regional location, where services are scarce and often not tailored to the unique needs of ageing individuals.

As someone deeply entrenched in the daily responsibilities of caring for both the older and younger generations, the compounded stress and physical demands are overwhelming.

Support systems that simplify processes and assist caregivers in navigating health, aged care, and home care services effectively would significantly ease the burden. The complexity of tasks involved in caregiving is exacerbated by the lack of straightforward information and guidance when dealing with government bodies.

In light of this, I urge you to consider supporting enhancements in caregiver resources, especially for individuals like myself in the ‘Sandwich Generation.’ We are caught between caring for ageing parents and our children. The introduction of Violet's national program appears to be a promising avenue to provide the necessary support, guidance, and simplified access to services that can truly make a difference.

Furthermore, attention must be focussed on regional areas like ours that often face added challenges due to location and limited local services.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, which affects not only my family but millions across Australia.

My name is Mandy Petrie from Heritage Park, QLD. I am writing to share part of my recent journey and to advocate for the thousands of Australians who find themselves in similar situations. For four years, I was the full-time carer for my late husband, George, who had multiple disabilities and high care needs due to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This resulted in RA-interstitial lung disease requiring an urgent double lung transplant and 216 days in ICU where our lives were changed forever. His final years were unfortunately complicated not only by his health challenges but also by significant administrative struggles with NDIS, impacting his dignity and our family's well-being.

Each week involved dedicating 21 hours for dialysis treatment, plus other appointments, constant attention to his ventilation needs and complex medical management at home. The financial strain was unfathomable; I stopped working to meet his care demands, NDIS coverage was insufficient and the financial burden was dire, as we struggled with the costs of additional medical and assistive technology expenses.

One of our greatest challenges was accessing necessary support. Despite obvious needs, we faced constant hurdles in justifying and obtaining the essential services that George required. The emotional toll of fighting for these basic rights, coupled with caregiving, was overwhelming. This experience illustrates a gaping need for comprehensive support for caregivers, especially as it pertains to planning and managing the last stages of life including how to cover funeral costs with significant grief and financial strain already impacting the family.  

I urge you to advocate for policies supporting caregivers nationally, particularly those managing end-of-life care in similar distressing circumstances. The introduction of a national program that aids in planning and provides tangible assistance for caregivers could transform many lives, ensuring dignity and support in the final stages of life and beyond.

This is only a very brief summary of the challenges George and I faced over the last four years, and when given the opportunity I will continue advocating for change by sharing more of our story.

My name is Marimar Salerno, and I am a full-time worker in the 2127 postcode area, currently supporting my 94-year-old father, Martin, as he navigates life in a hospital and the ongoing search for an affordable nursing home.

Every day, after work, I visit my father to ensure he has everything he needs—doing his washing, restocking his supplies, and ensuring his home remains intact. This has been the rhythm of my life recently, and it's emotionally draining and confusing balancing these responsibilities alongside my career.

Perhaps the most challenging aspect of my caregiving role is maintaining a veneer of normalcy while internally struggling to provide adequate support for my father. The complexity of navigating health, aged care, and home care services is incredibly overwhelming without a clear pathway or adequate support.

Having direct assistance in understanding and accessing services designed for elderly care and respite options would substantially alleviate the burden on our family. It would also enable me to better manage my time and emotional energy, contributing positively to my father's welfare and my capacity to continue working effectively.

I implore you to endorse and support initiatives like Violet’s national program, which aims to provide essential guidance and support to caregivers all across Australia. Such programs are crucial not only for improving the quality of life for our elderly population but also for supporting individuals like me who find themselves navigating these incredibly trying circumstances.

My name is Ruth Hendy, and I am writing to you from 2046, where I dedicate a significant part of my life to caring for my mother-in-law, Bridget, who is 72. Over the past few years, her health has visibly declined, bringing new responsibilities upon my shoulders.

The hardest part of this journey is witnessing Bridget's decline and feeling the pressing need to lean in more to provide the support she requires. The emotional toll is significant, and there are days when the balance between this commitment and other personal responsibilities seems almost impossible to manage.

What would truly make a difference for me, and many others in similar situations, is having access to resources that can guide us in having crucial conversations about end-of-life care and managing the evolving needs of our loved ones. This support could significantly relieve the emotional burden that comes with making tough decisions alone.

Therefore, I urge you to consider advocating for expanded support systems, particularly for those of us in the Sandwich Generation, who care for both our children and our aging parents. A national commitment to providing comprehensive support for caregivers will be increasingly essential as our population ages. Programs that offer guidance and emotional support for navigating aged care would not only assist caregivers but also ensure a higher quality of life for our elderly loved ones.

My name is Cora Moore and I reside in the suburb of Strathfield, caring full-time for my father, Ed Moore, who is battling with dementia. The transformation in my life over the past few years has been profound as my father's condition demands increasing attention, leaving me to manage his care around the clock. This role has not only placed an immense emotional strain on me but also significantly impacted my personal and professional life.

The hardest part of this caregiving journey is the sheer volume of time it consumes coupled with the emotional toll it takes. Every day brings new challenges that I often feel unprepared to handle. Particularly troubling is navigating the complexities of health, aged care, and home care services, alongside the daunting task of planning for the last stages of my father's life.

As someone in a rural setting, the lack of local resources and specialised support further complicates our situation. The isolation means that every small need becomes a huge ordeal, and obtaining professional assistance requires extensive travel, which is both tiring and time-consuming.

Given these challenges, I am reaching out to ask for your support for Violet’s national program. This initiative promises to offer much-needed guidance and assistance to families like mine, helping us navigate the daunting landscape of aged care. It provides vital tools to handle important conversations and support effective planning for end-of-life care, all of which are crucial to caregivers nationwide.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced support measures for caregivers, recognising the significant role we play in our society, particularly as our population ages. Improved support systems can profoundly affect the quality of life for both the elderly and their caregivers across Australia.

My name is Susie B, and I am currently the primary caregiver for my elderly mother and stepfather, both aged 85, living in Ballina, NSW 2478. As their health diminishes, my role has significantly pivoted towards managing frequent hospital visits and coordinating with various health services. What compounds these responsibilities is their inability to fully grasp their health situations and the complexity of the systems involved, often jeopardising their own safety.

The lion's share of my time is spent juggling these duties alongside my personal and professional life. The strain is not just logistical but heavily emotional, exacerbated by necessary but challenging family dynamics, where agreement is rare and stress is abundant. Support that could facilitate managing these family interactions would immensely improve our situation.

Given our nation's increasing elderly population, the need for robust support structures is more pressing than ever. This is not just the story of one family in a regional town but a common scenario playing out across Australia. I urge you to advocate for more comprehensive assistance for caregivers, particularly those navigating similar complexities in less urban settings.

I advocate your support for increasing funding and resources towards programs like those proposed by Violet, which aim to provide practical guidance and emotional support. Such initiatives are crucial in aiding caregivers to intelligently manage healthcare, legalities, and the emotional health of all involved.

Your action can significantly alleviate the pressures on caregivers nationwide and ensure our elderly population is cared for with dignity and compassion.

I am writing to you as a caregiver and friend to someone deeply cherished, who is enduring the twilight years with increased medical needs. Residing in the 2483 postcode, rural challenges amplify the complexities of our situation. My friend's health has deteriorated significantly, requiring my support twice a week, a commitment that while I hold dear, also stretches my capacity.

The journey has been profoundly challenging, as my friend becomes increasingly dependent. The emotional toll and physical demands of caregiving are compounded by our geographical isolation, which limits access to specialised health services and support systems. It's a silent battle that many in rural areas face, often unseen and unheard.

Support in the form of a national program such as Violet’s, dedicated to aiding caregivers, would be transformative. Such a program would not only provide practical guidance and emotional support but also enhance the navigation of aged care services, which is particularly cumbersome in less accessible regions.

I urge you to advocate for the funding of this indispensable service. As our population ages, the demand for caregiving will only escalate, and it is imperative that we bolster our support structures now. Investing in programs like Violet’s would offer relief and resources to countless Australians, ensuring they are not left to face these challenges alone.

My name is Anna Doncaster, and I find myself in the position of primary carer for both my elderly parents, Nanette and John Doncaster, who still reside in their own home in Suffolk Park. Three years ago, I returned from overseas to provide full-time care, leaving behind significant parts of my own life. My mother, aged 87, has advanced dementia requiring constant supervision, while my father, 88, also battles with deteriorating dementia.

This demanding role consumes up to 40 hours a week, leaving no room for employment, greatly impacting my financial stability and social life. The emotional toll is profound; my mother frequently does not recognise me and reacts with physical aggression. This level of care required has resulted in my dependence on a mental health plan to manage my own wellbeing.

The challenges in managing daily care tasks, navigating health services, and coping with family dynamics are immense. It's clear that a more supportive framework is required for carers like myself. I strongly advocate for MP support towards Violet’s national program, aiming to assist caregivers by offering critical guidance, support planning for life’s final stages, and help in managing complex family situations. This program would significantly aid in reducing the emotional and physical burden on carers, ensuring better quality care for our elderly and support for those who find themselves sandwiched between generations.

Since my father's passing from COVID and dementia, my mother lives alone and relies heavily on us for support. This shift has placed significant responsibilities on my shoulders, challenging me to balance familial duties amidst personal and professional obligations.

Being caught in the middle of caring for both generations is profoundly challenging.

I am the primary carer for my 81-year-old mother, who despite her independence, lives with cerebral palsy. Over the past few years, my role has evolved significantly, confronting challenges that accompany her advancing age and her condition.

Lately, we have faced considerable anxieties as our service provider attempted to retract crucial supports that ensure her well-being. This has thrust upon us not just an emotional strain but an administrative battle to maintain the care she needs and deserves.

Marjorie is deeply unhappy in the facility and expresses a desire to end her life, which heightens our distress and complicates the emotional dynamics within our family. I find myself constantly trying to navigate the aged care system and manage challenging family dynamics amidst my own emotional fatigue.

In recent years, his ability to perform daily tasks has significantly declined, leading me to become his full-time carer since October 2024. My career in nursing has paused, impacting our financial stability, as I am now behind on mortgage payments while navigating exorbitant care costs. Additionally, the limited carer's support, tested against my husband's wage, is inadequate in helping us meet our daily challenges.

Rod requires constant attention, adversely affecting every aspect of our family life, and placing emotional strain on my children still at home. The difficulty in accessing timely geriatric consultations has exacerbated our situation. After numerous hospitalisations, the absence of specialist interventions illustrates a critical gap in our healthcare system for rural families.

I urge you to advocate for improved support mechanisms that directly address the unique challenges faced by families like mine who reside in rural areas. We need a stronger national strategy to assist carers in managing health, aged care, and home care services efficiently.

Living in 2486, I commute four hours every fortnight to relieve my sister and her care team, providing essential 12-hour shifts to care for our mum. This commitment allows my sister some respite from the continuous 24/7 care that Pat requires.

The task of caring for mum at this stage of her dementia is incredibly challenging, emotionally draining, and financially straining as we strive to keep her at home amidst her increasing care needs. Despite not having any nursing training, I have had to quickly learn how to care for her, making the already tough job even harder. This arrangement is far from perfect, as it leaves me torn between my responsibilities towards my family and my mother, all while trying to maintain full-time employment.

The pressing need for support equipment, which is beyond our current financial capability, and managing family dynamics during such a stressful time pose ongoing challenges.

Over recent years, my role has dramatically shifted; I've found myself in the position of caring for my parents while still raising my own children. Each week, I undertake a 7-hour round trip to provide five days of personal care and emotional support to ensure my parents can continue living in their home. This commitment required leaving a job at a poorly staffed rural hospital and taking up new employment closer to my parents, significantly impacting my family life back home.

The emotional toll and guilt of not being fully available for my children and husband are profound.

My name is sdf, and I am currently faced with the considerable challenge of caring for my elderly mother while residing in the rural setting of Goulburn. Over the past few years, my role as her caregiver has intensified. As her necessities grow, so do the complexities of balancing family dynamics under stress, particularly when opinions clash on the best methods of care.

My week is filled with managing not just the physical requirements of my mother's care, but also the emotional and psychological support she needs. This demand has placed a strain both on my personal well-being and on my ability to maintain harmony within our family.

The hardest part of this experience, by far, is feeling equipped to handle the intense family dynamics that arise, especially under the pressure of making quick decisions that satisfy everyone involved. Adequate support in managing these dynamics and additional care-based guidance would significantly alleviate the daily stress we endure.

Thus, I am reaching out to advocate for robust national support for caregivers, specifically those in rural regions like mine where resources are often scarce. Programs such as Violet's national plan are crucial. They offer not just emotional support but also practical guidance in navigating aged care—a lifeline for those of us in the Sandwich Generation who care for elderly parents while rallying our own lives.

I strongly urge you to endorse funding for such essential services to ensure caregivers across Australia receive the support necessary to manage these profound responsibilities.

I am Jill Meredith, residing in the suburb with postcode 2256. I had been the primary caregiver for my husband who suffered from frontal lobe dementia until he passed away. My experiences during those intense caregiving days have left a lasting impression, particularly on the pervasive isolation and the toll it took on my personal well-being.

Caring around the clock often meant that my own self-care was neglected, adding to the emotional and physical drain. Dealing with what felt like a fragmented system only exacerbated this challenge. The hardest part, however, was the sense of loss—not just of my husband, but of my partner in navigating daily life and the very systems meant to aid us.

In rural areas like ours, the challenge is twofold due to limited access to resources and professional support, making it difficult to have crucial conversations about care and future planning. What would significantly make a difference is targeted support which helps in managing both the immediate needs and the strategic planning required for dementia care.

I urge you to advocate for enhanced national support programs, such as Violet's national program, which could offer vital resources and guidance to caregivers. This would not only aid in immediate support but also help in better planning and management of caregiving in Australia’s ageing population.

Strengthening our support systems for caretakers not only aids in immediate welfare but safeguards the emotional and physical health of those willing to undertake such vital roles in our community.

Yours sincerely,

My name is Claudia Teal from Avoca Beach, and I am reaching out amid my substantial caregiving responsibilities which include caring for my elderly mother Colleen, aged 84, and my mother-in-law Eunice, aged 88. Besides this, I support my son Charlie, aged 21, who is autistic. Balancing these caregiving duties with a full-time job and raising another teenager means my life is a continual act of juggling emotional, financial, and physical demands with extremely limited personal time.

Both Colleen and Eunice require extensive daily support ranging from health care management to social engagements, compounding the commonplace challenges of rural caregiving such as access to specialised services and facilities. The necessity to manage these commitments alongside my son’s transition out of school brings an overwhelming burden, leaving little room for respite or self-care.

What would considerably lighten this load are clearly accessible resources to help navigate Australia’s intricate health and aged care systems and planning for end-of-life stages. Support in these areas would not only benefit my family directly but also serve as a lifeline for countless Australians in similar situations. The feeling of being perpetually overwhelmed is a common thread among us, the ‘Sandwich Generation’, who care for both elderly parents and young children.

I urge you to advocate for increased funding and support for programs like Violet's national initiative, which promises to offer practical guidance and emotional support. Engaging with and enhancing such services is crucial as we face an aging population with increasingly complex needs.

My name is Debbie Roberts, and I recently faced one of the most heart-wrenching periods of my life: caring for my mum, Yvonne Griggs, as she approached the end of her life. Mum was fiercely independent, but illness took that independence away, leaving her frustrated and bedridden. Despite her wish to pass away at home, I had to admit her to a hospital because the care she needed was more than I could provide alone.

For four months, I placed my life on hold—stepping back from work to be with Mum in her final days. I experienced first-hand the emotional and physical toll it takes to care for a loved one in their last stage of life. The most difficult part was not just the caregiving tasks, like feeding and managing Mum’s discomfort, but watching her deteriorate so rapidly before my eyes.

Support services that facilitate important conversations about end-of-life care would have made a significant difference for us. It could have helped manage Mum’s expectations and better prepare me for the challenges we faced, reducing the emotional strain for both of us.

Given the aging population of Australia, this personal struggle speaks to a larger, national issue affecting millions. I urge you to advocate for enhanced caregiver support and endorse initiatives like Violet’s national program. Such programs can offer both practical guidance and emotional support to families struggling with parental care across the country, ensuring they do not face these hardships alone.

Thank you for considering this vital issue. Your support could help transform the lives of countless Australian families providing elderly care.

My name is Fenton Beck, and I live in the postcode 2250. I am writing as both a son and a nephew, caring for my 80-year-old mother, Joan, and my 84-year-old uncle, Alan. Alongside this, I am raising my 17-year-old daughter, Evelyn. The increasing frailty of my loved ones has deeply intensified their care needs, and every day presents new hurdles that are both physically and emotionally taxing.

At present, I am consumed by the responsibilities of caregiving, which alone is enough to bring me to tears. The challenge is not just in the physical acts of care but also in managing and navigating health, aged care, and home care services for them, all while trying to provide Evelyn with the attention and support she needs through her critical teenage years.

The hardest part? Everything. Balancing these duties with other aspects of life seems almost impossible and keeps me awake at night, worrying about the future and the well-being of both my mother and uncle.

In Australia, many families are in similar situations, confronting both the emotional and logistical challenges of caregiving. This is especially pronounced in regions like ours, where distance and access to services add further complexity to our efforts.

To alleviate this national issue, I strongly advocate for your support towards funding Violet’s national program. This initiative will provide essential guidance, emotional support, and practical assistance in navigating aged care services, which would be invaluable to families like mine across the country.

My name is Tanya Martin from the suburb of Bellbowrie. I am currently the primary caregiver for my elderly parents, aged 80 and 84. After work each weekday, I ensure they are fed, medicated, and cared for until they sleep. This commitment, though done out of love, greatly impacts my own family life and health.

The most taxing part of this journey is the realisation that, despite my efforts, the needs are growing, and my ability to manage alone diminishes. Balancing full-time work and the emotional and physical demands of caregiving without adequate support is unsustainable. Additionally, managing family dynamics, especially under stress, has proven to be a relentless challenge.

Like many others in similar situations across Australia, I find that the availability of support services could greatly alleviate the emotional weight and logistical struggles we face daily. Tailored help could facilitate a better balance, ensuring both my parents' welfare and the health of my family life.

Therefore, I call on your support for improved national caregiver support programs, specifically Violet’s national program, which promises practical guidance and emotional support. This support is crucial not only for caregivers like myself but also in preparing our society to address the needs of an ageing population effectively.

My name is Anonymous, and I find myself navigating the challenging journey of caring for an ageing relative. This role has significantly evolved over the years, becoming more demanding of both my time and emotional resources.

At present, I dedicate substantial time each week to this care, all while attempting to manage complex family dynamics that often arise in high-stress situations. These familial disagreements and stress only compound the difficulties, making a tough situation even harder for everyone involved.

This experience illuminates the realities faced by countless Australians, particularly those of us who are part of the ‘Sandwich Generation’. We juggle caregiving with other personal and professional responsibilities, striving to ensure our loved ones receive the love and care they deserve, without neglecting other areas of our lives.

It is clear that structured support could make a profound difference not just in my life but in the lives of many others in similar situations. Access to resources that help manage family dynamics and provide clear guidance on navigating the aged care landscape would ease our considerable burdens.

Therefore, I am calling on your support for Violet’s national program, which promises practical guidance and emotional support to family caregivers across Australia. By supporting this initiative, you will help ensure that Australians who shoulder the responsibility of caregiving do not have to do so at the expense of their health, careers, and family life.

My name is Kim Lawrence and I navigate the delicate daily balance of caring for my father, Bill, staying connected with frequent phone calls, alongside managing my own family's needs. The future of my father’s health remains uncertain, and this unpredictability is the hardest aspect for me to handle emotionally and practically.

While my caring duties have not escalated to physical day-to-day care, the emotional toll and the challenge of planning for an increasingly dependent future are significant. I find myself torn between my children’s demands and the potential needs of my father, a sentiment echoed by many in the 'Sandwich Generation' who are caught between raising children and caring for elderly relatives.

What would considerably relieve this strain is having access to resources that can guide me in having critical conversations and making informed decisions about my father’s future care. Unfortunately, this type of support is often hard to come by, leaving many of us feeling unprepared and overwhelmed.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for the support of Violet’s national program.

My name is Nicola Morgan from The Gap, Brisbane. As a full-time employee, mother to a teenager with autism, and daughter to an aging father without financial security, the balance of my daily responsibilities is precarious.

My father, Chris, aged 81, lives alone, managing his finances by renting out rooms. Recently, he’s shown signs of forgetfulness and frailty, which raises concerns about his future care needs. This situation has forced me to intervene financially and administratively, costing our family over $10,000 for emergencies alone. The financial strain has been considerable, impacting not only my marriage but also our capacity to prepare for probable future scenarios, like housing him or managing aged care services.

My name is Jules Juka, and I call the peaceful town of South Morang home. My mother, Anne Coyle, aged 78, has Alzheimer's. We recently lost my father, and within eighteen months, mum was diagnosed and my life transformed drastically. My husband and I now share the full-time caregiving responsibilities. We are what you would call the 'Sandwich Generation'—juggling the care of young children and an elderly parent in our home.

The emotional and physical toll of caring for my mum while raising a three-year-old and a six-month-old is immense. I am constantly exhausted, drained, and find myself grappling with profound sadness. The most heart-wrenching part is witnessing my mother's gradual decline while simultaneously losing precious moments with my husband and children.

I urge you to support enhancements to the national programs assisting families like ours. We need systems that not only understand the unique challenges of caregivers in rural and regional areas but also provide real, tangible support to navigate these challenging waters.

My name is Anica Simic, residing in Charlestown. I am presently navigating the complex role of caring for both my elderly parents, Kiril and Dragica Sterjovski. At 88, my father was recently diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, a condition that has greatly diminished his capacity to care for my 86-year-old mother, who herself deals with multiple health issues. 

This sudden shift in my father's health has propelled me into the full-time role of a carer, coordinating and attending all medical appointments, and managing their household needs due to his limited English proficiency. Balancing this critical responsibility with my full-time job and supporting my own children—who are new parents themselves and currently live with me as they save for a home—has put considerable strain on my personal and professional life.

The emotional toll of watching my father suffer and trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy for them is immense. Both of my parents constantly apologise for the pressures their care places on me, which adds to the emotional weight of my role.

The challenges I face are further intensified by a lack of easily accessible information and support navigating the health, aged care, and home care services available. Supportive initiatives like Violet's national program would provide immense relief by offering guidance, emotional support, and practical assistance not only to me but to many Australians in similar situations.

Over the last few years, my ability to live independently has drastically diminished due to injury, an increasingly poor immune system, and severe drug sensitivity. This has left me significantly isolated, with little to no support available to manage my day-to-day life.

Isolation has been the hardest part of this experience. The emotional toll is immense, and the lack of local support services compounds the difficulty of my situation.

This role has deeply affected every aspect of my life, impacting my work, my well-being, and the time I can devote to my three children and husband.

The responsibilities of caregiving have stretched me thin. In addition to managing my mother's care, I travel extensively – nearly 3.5 months annually, divided into weekly trips – to ensure she and my late father received the care they needed.

The inability to access necessary care packages timely due to bureaucratic delays and limited local services hampers our efforts to provide decent care.

Since my father's passing over two years ago, and following Mum's dementia diagnosis, her needs have intensified dramatically. I find myself in the role of her primary joy-bringer, visiting several times a week and managing daily calls with her, and with the care team, to ensure she maintains a connection with her sense of self amidst her cognitive decline.

Navigating this journey alone, without the help of my siblings, has left me perpetually exhausted. The emotional and physical toll of managing Mum’s care while trying to balance my own life's responsibilities is overwhelming. I often find myself in need of support with planning for Mum's final stages, having critical conversations about her care, and navigating the complex landscape of health and aged care services.

The challenges I face are not unique to me; they echo across our nation among many who find themselves caring for elderly loved ones with inadequate support. This is why I am requesting your advocacy for more robust national support systems for caregivers. Programs like Violet's national program could provide essential guidance and support, reducing the immense burden carried by family caregivers across Australia.

I urge you to consider the profound impact that enhanced caregiver support can have not just on individuals like myself, but on our community as a whole. As our population ages, the demand for such support will only grow.

Thank you for considering this crucial issue.

Warm regards,

My name is Robert Small, and I write to you as a son relentlessly navigating the complexities of eldercare for my 88-year-old stepfather, Clive, whose life has been markedly changed by dementia and financial misfortunes. This responsibility shifted profoundly to my sister and me after we lost our mother, increasing our caretaking duties substantially to include full financial and residential management amidst personal and professional upheaval, including a challenging home recovery post the 2020 fires.

The relentless necessity to be perpetually strong for Clive, while managing his financial affairs and witnessing his decline, has been the hardest part of this journey. Seeing a once vibrant man diminishing due to illness is heartbreakingly tough.

Our situation is shared by many, and underscores the burgeoning need to support the ‘Sandwich Generation’—those of us caring for elderly parents while managing personal responsibilities. Support in navigating health, aged care, and home care services, along with guidance for planning the last stages of life, would provide not only practical help but also much-needed peace of mind.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for the implementation of Violet’s national program. This pivotal resource would significantly aid caregivers across Australia by providing essential support and resources that address both the emotional and logistical challenges faced in eldercare.

Your support could transform countless lives, ensuring that families can provide care without sacrificing their well-being or financial stability.

My name is Susan Clemow, and I am writing to you from Darlinghurst, where I live and care for my 95-year-old father, William. In late 2021, I moved him from a retirement village on the Gold Coast to live with me, significantly changing our lives. As William regresses, our roles have reversed—I now find myself as the caregiver to the man who once cared for me.

Caring for my father seven days a week while maintaining a 4-day work schedule is an immense challenge. I manage his daily needs, from preparing meals to handling his cleaning and medical appointments. My partner, who now visits only on Saturdays, assists, but the emotional and physical toll is relentless. The constant companionship and care required are new to me after over two decades of living mostly independently.

The hardest part of this journey is feeling overwhelmed and underprepared for the intricate responsibilities of navigating health, aged care, and end-of-life care services. A structured support system would be invaluable, one that includes guidance on having crucial conversations and planning for the final stages of life.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for the expansion and support of national programmes like Violet's, which provide essential resources for caregivers. Such programmes are vital for helping Australians like me manage the complexities of aged care, balancing work, and personal well-being.

My name is Kris Htims, and I am writing to you from my home in 6156 where I live with the joy and challenge of caring for my three-year-old granddaughter, Hazel. Three days a week, Hazel is under my watchful eye, a role I have taken on with no financial assistance, all while managing my own health as a disability pensioner.

In recent years, my caregiving responsibilities have intensified significantly. The transition from occasional visits to becoming a primary carer has placed a considerable strain on my finances and physical health. Caring for a young child brings exposure to frequent sickness, which is particularly hard for someone with disabilities. The financial unpredictability, coupled with isolation, has made this journey even more challenging. 

Support in managing family dynamics and coping with the emotional and financial pressures of caregiving would immensely improve our lives. The need to understand and address the unique pressures faced by carers like myself — who juggle health issues and caregiving responsibilities — is critical. 

I urge you to advocate for policies that acknowledge and support carers in their multifaceted challenges. Improvement in caregiver support, including financial and emotional assistance, is vital for enhancing the quality of care provided to our loved ones and the well-being of caregivers themselves.

Your support in promoting initiatives that address these issues can make a significant difference, not just in individual lives like mine, but across our community as our demographic shifts towards an ageing population.

I am Fiona Heenan, residing in postcode 3305, where I have found myself increasingly in the role of a carer, rather than just a sister, to my 54-year-old brother, Cam. Cam is bravely facing a degenerative disease, which is causing his health to deteriorate at a distressingly young age. Observing this decline week by week is indescribably painful and challenging.

As his primary support, I help him navigate the intricacies of the NDIS every week, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that additional support in accessing health, aged care, and home care services would be significantly beneficial. The emotional toll and physical demands of caregiving have profound impacts, influencing not just the life of the caregiver but also the quality of care received by the loved one.

The difficulty we face is exacerbated because of our location, where specialised resources and immediate support services are not as readily available as they are in more urban settings. This rural aspect of caregiving often means we are at a disadvantage, struggling with limited access to necessary services that could help ease my brother’s life and my caregiving journey.

Therefore, I implore you to advocate for better national support systems for caregivers, especially those in rural, regional, and remote areas like ours. Please support funding for programs such as Violet’s national initiative, which aims to provide practical guidance and emotional support, assisting families like mine in navigating aged care services more effectively.

Your consideration and action towards improved caregiver support will profoundly impact many lives across our nation.

I am Lindy Carabott, a resident of postcode 3272, writing to you as a devoted daughter and caregiver to my elderly parents, Carol, aged 80, and James, aged 83. Over recent years, I've increasingly taken on the role of supporting them as they navigate the complexities of aging. This commitment occupies an enormous part of my day, often averaging around eight hours, impacting the time available for my children, husband, and my ability to earn a living.

The hardest part of my caregiving journey is managing the intense family dynamics. Disagreements and lack of assistance from other family members exacerbate the emotional toll on everyone involved. I find myself continually sandwiched between the needs of my parents and my family, trying to balance these while managing critique about the choices I make for my parents' care.

Support in managing these family dynamics, alongside assistance with planning for the last stages of my parents' lives, would significantly alleviate the pressure we face. There is a pressing need for structured support for caregivers like me across Australia, particularly for the 'Sandwich Generation', grappling with the responsibilities of parenting our children and caring for our aging parents.

I implore you to support and advocate for funding Violet’s national program. This initiative is vital in providing the practical guidance, emotional support, and resources necessary for families like mine to navigate this challenging phase of life more effectively. Programs like these are not just investments in individual families but in the future of our community welfare.

The emotional and physical toll of managing my mother’s finances, doctor appointments, and household maintenance, while also navigating family dynamics to protect her from financial abuse, is overwhelming. Balancing these substantial responsibilities with a demanding career and personal life leaves me exhausted and anxious about the future.

The hardest part of this complex juggling act is the immense pressure to meet everyone’s needs effectively without a respite. Like many in the 'Sandwich Generation', I am caught between the demands of raising children and caring for an ageing parent.

The introduction of support programs like Violet’s national program could provide crucial guidance and assistance in managing family dynamics and caring responsibilities.

As an individual who deeply engaged in the care of my elderly parent, I experienced firsthand the complexity of finding appropriate health and home care services, a plight that affects countless Australian families today.

The journey through my mother's final years highlighted the significant gaps in our current system, particularly the difficulties in accessing clear and reliable information about aged care options. What I and many others need are robust support systems that simplify these processes, ensuring that our elderly loved ones receive the care they deserve without undue stress on families.

Violet's national program has the potential to provide such support, offering guidance that can alleviate the emotional and logistical burdens caregivers face. I urge you to advocate for funding this vital initiative, which promises to transform the way we manage aged care in Australia.

Living in a rural area like 3231 intensifies the challenges of caregiving. The limited availability of health, aged care, and home care services in our region often leaves us feeling isolated and underserved. This isolation is compounded by the emotional and logistical strains of managing my mother's care alongside my other responsibilities.

My name is Stuart Davidson, a resident of postcode 3284, and I am currently the primary caregiver for my aunt, Sue, who is 74 years old. Over the past few years, my role has evolved into a live-in care situation, where I manage Sue's daily living activities. This role is both challenging and frustrating due to the complexities of her needs and the lack of available support.

Providing care for Sue requires significant time and effort, which has become increasingly difficult to balance with other family responsibilities and dynamics, especially when stress levels rise and consensus is hard to find among family members. The emotional toll and the constant management of conflicting opinions within the family have been some of the hardest parts of this journey.

The lack of support structures in place for caregivers like myself not only affects our ability to provide care but also impacts our overall well-being and the dynamics of our wider family relationships. Assistance in managing family dynamics effectively and providing caregiver support would make a substantial difference in our lives.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for the implementation of better support systems for caregivers nationwide. An enhanced focus on this issue will cater to the needs of Australia's ageing population and relieve the burdens faced by family caregivers, ensuring that they have the necessary resources to manage these challenging circumstances.

As the primary caregiver for my 98-year-old mother, I am reaching out to express the urgent need for enhanced support for Australians like me, who are part of the 'Sandwich Generation,' juggling caregiving with other substantial life responsibilities.

In recent years, my role has evolved to nearly a part-time job, devoted to ensuring my mother can continue living independently. This commitment consumes about half of my available time each week, impacting my ability to maintain my own household and meet personal obligations. The emotional and physical toll is significant, and the challenge of managing these responsibilities continues to grow.

Each week, my responsibilities vary widely from managing simple medical appointments to implementing complex care plans, consuming several hours that often conflict with the needs of my own dependent children.

For far too many Australians, particularly in the 'Sandwich Generation', this dual responsibility results in an agonising choice between caring for ageing parents and fulfilling commitments to our children and careers. This constant juggling act has forced me to utilise my annual leave to address my father's medical needs – a sacrifice that impacts both my financial stability and emotional wellbeing.

The difficulties of coordinating care, which fluctuate dramatically, underscore the urgent need for structured support systems that can assist families like mine to navigate the harrowing journey through aged care and family dynamics. Specifically, programs that assist with important conversations about advanced care planning, alongside navigating the labyrinth of health, aged and home care services, would be invaluable.

Thus, I urge you to advocate for better support at a national level for caregivers across Australia through funding and policies, such as those proposed in Violet’s national program.

The responsibility fell on me to manage his care from across the state, and oversee his My Aged Care support, which proved to be an immense challenge due to bureaucratic delays.

Each fortnight, I travelled from Bondi to Bathurst to provide personal and medical support to my father.

This situation presents unique challenges, especially due to my son’s emerging severe mental health condition layered with the standard care requirements of my elderly mother. There are times when the struggle feels insurmountable, and the emotional and physical toll it takes is indescribable.

I am reaching out to urge you to advocate for and support robust initiatives that assist caregivers nationally, like Violet’s national program. Prioritising funding for these services would offer vital resources for families like mine, helping us navigate health, aged care, and mental health services more effectively. We need more than just basic support; we need a system that understands and adapts to the complexities of caring for multiple generations with comprehensive needs.

Your action can provide relief not only to our family but to countless others across the nation wrestling with similar burdens. Please consider the profound impact your support could have in making our challenging journeys just a little easier.

My name is Nicole Palmer, and I reside in the beautiful yet remote area of postcode 2571. As a mother to two young daughters, ages 9 and 3, I also care full-time for my 65-year-old mother who was recently diagnosed with cancer. 

Caring for my mother involves managing constant medical appointments, providing daily assistance, and advocating tirelessly on her behalf. The emotional toll and physical demands of balancing these responsibilities with raising my daughters are indescribable. The challenge is magnified by our location, which limits access to specialised healthcare services and support networks that are more readily available in urban areas.

The hardest part, undoubtedly, is maintaining this balance—ensuring my mother's needs are met while providing my children with the love and attention they deserve. The strain on my time and emotional wellbeing is immense, and without additional support, I worry about the long-term impacts on my family’s wellbeing and my ability to continue performing these caregiving roles effectively.

It is against this backdrop that I urge your support for the national rollout of Violet's program, which promises to offer significant relief and support to caregivers like myself across Australia, particularly those in rural and remote communities. This program is not just a service but a necessity for securing the health and wellbeing of our elderly population and their caregivers.

Your advocacy for this cause can significantly enhance the quality of life for countless Australian families. Please help us not just survive, but thrive.

My name is Virginia Marie, from the rural suburb of Robertson, postcode 2577. I write to share my personal journey caring for my 83-year-old father, Graham, and to seek your advocacy for improved support systems for caregivers like myself across the country.

In recent years, my role as a caregiver has deepened significantly. I am responsible for managing Graham's medical appointments among other daily needs. This responsibility is proving increasingly difficult as Graham desires Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD), a service not currently accessible to him, leaving him in distress and me struggling to manage his emotional turmoil.

Living in a rural area adds another layer of complexity to our situation. The limited local healthcare services mean that every medical appointment involves extensive travel, adding to the physical and emotional toll of caregiving.

The hardest part of this experience is witnessing my father's continual suffering and feeling powerless in my ability to alleviate his pain. It's a challenge that not only impacts me but reverberates throughout our family.

I am writing to ask for your support in advocating for increased funding and development of a national program such as Violet’s. This program would provide essential guidance and support for rural caregivers who are navigating the complexities of aged care, including those dealing with complex cases like VAD.

As Australia's population ages, it is crucial that we support caregivers who are dedicating their lives to the care of elderly family members. Your leadership can bring about the necessary support and resources that can substantially ease this burden.

Thank you for considering this significant issue. I look forward to your support in making caregiving a manageable role for all Australians.

My name is Virginia, and I live in the rural area of Bowral, NSW. I am the primary caregiver for Andrew, my 63-year-old step-mother and guardian who is grappling with escalating mental health issues. As Andrew’s condition has deteriorated over the last year, the difficulties we face in a regional setting have grown considerably.

Providing care in a remote location means limited access to specialised health services and professionals trained in geriatric and mental health care. Each week I navigate these gaps in services, while also managing the emotional and logistical challenges posed by Andrew’s mental state, often feeling overwhelmed and under-supported.

The hardest part is the communication barrier that his condition creates. Understanding his needs and ensuring he feels safe and cared for can be an exhausting, full-time endeavour that leaves little room for professional or personal life balance. Furthermore, the distance and isolation from critical health infrastructure compound our daily struggles. 

Support in navigating health, aged care, and home care services would immensely change our lives. Clear, accessible information and local support networks are crucial but currently lacking in our community.

Therefore, I urge your active support for a national program like Violet, which aims to provide vital guidance and emotional support for caregivers. Advocating for improved resources and support systems will not only help caregivers like myself but will also address the broader challenges faced by aging Australians, particularly in rural areas.

Your commitment to supporting this initiative will make a real difference to countless families across Australia who are doing their best to care for loved ones in increasingly complex circumstances.

My name is Sharon Atkins from postcode 4650, and I am reaching out to share the realities of my dual role as a carer for my 82-year-old mother, Sheila Henderson, and as a mother to my two children, Ayala and James. Over the past few years, as Mum’s needs have intensified due to ageing, I have had to adapt significantly, including purchasing a more suitable home to share with her.

The financial strain of managing bills, a mortgage, and the unending responsibilities of care is immense. I am always on call, balancing these duties with the needs of my children, which is increasingly becoming untenable. The hardest part has been the emotional and monetary toll it's taking on our family, leaving us feeling stretched beyond our limits.

Federal support for caregivers in my situation is crucial. We need accessible assistance that aids in navigating the complexities of health, aged care, and home care services effectively. Programmes like Violet’s national initiative could provide essential support by offering practical guidance and emotional support, which would significantly impact our ability to manage daily challenges.

I urge you to advocate for and support funding for such national programmes that focus on both the elderly and their caregivers. Investing in these services is not only vital for families like mine but is essential as Australia’s population ages, ensuring we are all supported through these challenging transitions.

I am writing to you as Clare Morrison, a resident of postcode 4565. I find myself as part of the 'Sandwich Generation', caring for three elderly individuals who each require extensive support. My caregiving responsibilities entail dedicating around 40 hours per week to ensure they are well looked after—time that significantly affects both my work and family life.

One of the most challenging aspects of this role has been managing the emotional and logistical complexities within the family, especially as stress levels mount and disagreements arise over the best care practices. These situations not only strain familial relations but also compound the mental and emotional toll on myself as the primary caregiver.

The support I critically need involves assistance in navigating and managing these difficult family dynamics, alongside guidance in the broader scope of caregiving. Programs like Violet’s national program offer a beacon of hope, potentially easing these burdens by providing essential resources and support tailored to caregivers across Australia.

The demand for resources that help caregivers like myself is becoming increasingly urgent as our population ages. I urge you to advocate for and support the expansion of initiatives like Violet's that not only acknowledge but actively assist the integral work done by countless Australians in similar circumstances.

Our collective contribution to society as caregivers is substantial, and with the right support, we can continue to care for our loved ones without sacrificing our own well-being and familial harmony.

My name is Inge Kristine Howland from Booubyjan, postcode 4601. Eight weeks ago, following the passing of my father, I, alongside my sister, took on the full-time care of our mother who suffers from dementia. This transition has not only intensified the emotional toll on our family but also made it exceedingly challenging to balance work, self-care, and caregiving duties.

Living in a regional area exacerbates these challenges, stemming largely from limited local healthcare resources and difficulties in accessing specialised dementia care and aged care services. The emotional weight is immense and navigating the complexities of health and aged care systems often feels bewildering and overwhelming.

I am writing to impress upon you the urgent need for improved support and resources for caregivers like myself, especially in regional and remote areas. The implementation of Violet’s national program would be a significant step towards providing the necessary guidance, emotional support and practical help needed by families undergoing similar circumstances.

I urge you to advocate for this essential service, to ensure that families who are devoting their lives to care for elderly parents are not left to struggle in isolation.

My name is Justine Wilkinson from Maryborough, postcode 4650. I am in my 60s and currently support my mother, who can no longer make decisions independently. Daily, I provide her with companionship and basic care, but witnessing her decline has been profoundly challenging both emotionally and practically.

Living in a regional area like Tumut, NSW, presents unique hurdles. Accessibility to specialised healthcare services is limited, and obtaining adequate support for end-of-life planning is a complex process burdened by geographical constraints. This is all while managing work and daily life responsibilities.

Families in similar situations, who are part of the 'Sandwich Generation', are extensively struggling to juggle the care of elderly parents while fulfilling their own family and career obligations. The emotional toll and physical exhaustion are significant, yet there is an evident lack of structured support systems to alleviate these challenges.

I urge you to endorse the establishment of Violet's national program, aimed at providing holistic support for caregivers. This initiative would vastly improve our ability to manage caregiving responsibilities by furnishing essential guidance, emotional reinforcement, and practical help with navigating aged care services.

Recognising the needs of caregivers and supporting them through structured programs is crucial as Australia's population continues to age. I ask for your active support in advocating for solutions that address the challenges faced by the 'Sandwich Generation', especially those in rural and regional communities.

My name is Amy from Glenroy, and I am writing to seek your support as I navigate the profound challenges of caring for my 72-year-old parent, who requires a significant level of assistance. Over the last few years, my role as a caregiver has intensified dramatically—from visiting a few times a month to providing care every second day. Not only do I manage nearly all their personal admin, but I also drive them to most of their appointments.

The shift from occasional visits to almost daily care has put immense pressure on my life. I am employed as a disability carer, and thus, between work and caring for my parent, I no longer have days off. The emotional and financial stress is overwhelming. We were approved for funding six months ago, yet we still have not received the help we desperately need. This situation is distressing, not only because of the unmet need but because I feel I'm losing connection with my mum during this time when she needs me the most.

The solitary nature of my situation is crushing. On days when I need her most, the emotional support I seek from my mum just isn't possible due to her condition. The lack of practical assistance has drained my emergency funds and pushed me to the brink of a mental health crisis. Caregiver counselling and coaching have been provided, but what I truly need is ongoing practical help.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for better support systems for caregivers like myself, and to support Violet's national program that aids in navigating health, aged care and home care services. This program would not only provide much-needed support but also guide families in having critical conversations about care and ensure no one has to face this journey alone.

My name is Clare Goodwin and I am reaching out today as a concerned daughter and citizen who is experiencing the challenges of caring for an elderly parent from a distance. My father, aged 87, resides in a different location, which significantly impacts our family dynamics and my ability to participate effectively in his caring process.

Living away from my father means I rely on weekly phone calls to stay connected and try to manage his needs. However, my efforts are complicated by being isolated from my sibling who makes most of the decisions about his care. This situation has left me feeling unheard and shut out, leading to constant stress and helplessness, affecting my well-being and my ability to support him in meaningful ways.

The hardest part of this journey has been the lack of influence and communication within our family about my father's care. Better support in managing family dynamics, particularly during such emotionally charged circumstances, would be invaluable not only to me but to many Australians in similar situations.

Therefore, I firmly ask for your support in advocating for a national program that addresses these unique challenges faced by remote caregivers like myself. Such a program would provide essential guidance and support, helping to bridge the gap caused by physical distance and improving the involvement and mental health of caregivers separated from their loved ones.

Your advocacy for this cause will not only aid in maintaining the dignity and quality of life for our elderly but also recognise and support the silent sacrifices of countless caregivers across our nation.

My name is Jess Hurst, and I reside in Glenroy, VIC. As the primary carer for my father, Tony, who is 74 and battles with dementia, I have transitioned from being his daughter to his full-time caregiver. Tony remains in his own home, but the journey has been fraught with emotional and logistical challenges, not least because of our complex family dynamics and the significant financial strain due to our limited incomes.

Navigating the aged care system to plan for his eventual move to retirement care while managing my work commitments consumes a substantial amount of time and energy. The scarcity of accessible home help services and the complexity of these systems only add to our daily struggles.

The hardest hitting has been the shift in our relationship, where I find myself in a parental role to my own father. This reversal of roles, especially under the cloud of past relationship strains, adds an emotional toll that is difficult to articulate.

Substantial support in navigating health, aged care, and home care services, alongside help managing family dynamics, would immensely ease our burden. Assistance in planning for the last stages of life is crucial not just for us but for countless Australians in similar situations.

Therefore, I urge you to advocate for and support funding for Violet’s national program. This program would provide invaluable guidance, support, and resources for families like mine, helping us to navigate these overwhelming challenges more effectively.

In addition to navigating her appointments and daily needs, I am also balancing the responsibilities of parenting my children who are in their critical high school years.

The emotional and physical demands of ensuring my mother has a fulfilling day, coupled with my familial responsibilities, leave little time for managing my own health and well-being. The inability to take a complete family holiday or even a day off without intensive planning adds to the stress. The hardest part? I’m responsible for the care and happiness of my dear mother at a time where my children still need me tremendously.

Support in understanding and accessing health, aged care, and home care services would significantly ease the pressure. With Australia’s ageing population, it is imperative that we recognise the struggles faced not just by the elderly, but by their caregivers who often juggle multiple life roles.

I implore you to advocate for enhanced support systems including funding for initiatives like Violet’s national program. This program is indispensable, offering practical guidance and crucial emotional support for caregivers.

I write to you as Christine So, living in the 4210 area. I am currently the primary carer for my mother, Rosemarie, who is 73 years old. Mum has recently been hospitalised due to another fall, aggravated by her struggle with alcohol as a means to manage her pain. This situation stems partly from stubbornness on her part and my ongoing exertion to persuade her to adopt safer, healthier habits.

Caring for Mum does not just involve physical attendance but also aiding her with financial decisions and navigating anything technological—areas she feels out of depth with due to her age.

The most challenging part of this journey is reckoning with our fraught past, setting aside childhood traumas to help her in her later years. It is both emotionally draining and time-consuming, a story I share with countless other Australians in similar circumstances.

There is a dire need for better support systems to help carers like myself navigate health, aged care, and home care services more efficiently. This support would ease our burden significantly and improve the quality of life for our loved ones.

Thus, I am requesting your advocacy for the funding of Violet's national program. This initiative would provide essential guidance, emotional support, and practical help in managing aged care services, which is critical for family caregivers across Australia managing similar tribulations.

My mother, particularly, has become almost entirely dependent on me for daily support, struggling significantly with her day-to-day activities. Balancing full-time employment, I find myself stopping each morning and evening to provide critical assistance to them, mainly concerning meals and personal care.

The reality of today’s demands and the emotional toll of caring for my loved ones, without the ability to give them the quality of care they truly deserve, has been incredibly challenging. Being part of what is known as the 'Sandwich Generation', I face the dual pressure of providing for my parents while managing my own life and employment commitments.
